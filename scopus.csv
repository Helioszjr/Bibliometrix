However, apart from this, some other SDLC models are also available for selection in front of software developers to develop any software. Usually, project managers select any of these models to develop software through their past experiences. There is no logical basis for this selection to be completely correct, as a result of which there is always a risk of software failure or over budget if an inappropriate model has opted. Keeping this problem of software industries in mind, an ideal SDLC model has been identified mathematically in this article. In this article, we applied the Fuzzy TOPSIS method that validates Agile software development as an ideal choice. We have taken a total of six software development processes that are being applied globally. Feedback from five experienced decision-makers has been taken in the form of linguistic terms and further converted into fuzzy values to perform the computation of the closeness coefficient rank of each experimented alternative software development process. © 2022","Agile Software Development; Decision support system; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Multi-Criteria Decision Making; Software Development Process","Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Decision making; Fuzzy logic; Linguistics; Software design; Agile Methodologies; Agile software development; Fuzzy-Logic; fuzzy-TOPSIS; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Software developer; Software development process; TOPSIS method; Decision support systems",,,,,,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",,,,,,,,,,"Nayak, V., D'Souza, D.R., A survey on multi-criteria decision making methods in software engineering (2018) Int J Innovat Sci Res Technol, 3 (7), pp. 366-374; Aggarwal, K.K., Singh, Y., Software Engineering (2009), Third Ed New Age International (P) Limited Publishers; Meyer, A.N., Barr, E.T., Bird, C., Zimmermann, T., Today was a good day: the daily life of software developers (2021) IEEE Trans Softw Eng, 47 (5), pp. 863-880; Sinha, R., Patil, S., Gomes, L., Vyatkin, V., A survey of static formal methods for building dependable industrial automation systems (2019) IEEE Trans Ind Inf, 15 (7), pp. 3772-3783; Sharma, A., Vardhan, M., Kushwaha, D.S., A Versatile approach for the estimation of software development effort based on SRS document (2014) Int J Softw Eng Knowledge Eng, 24 (1), pp. 1-42; Ali, N., Lai, R., Global software development: a review of its practices (2021) Malaysian J Comput Sci, 34 (1), pp. 82-129. , https://ejournal.um.edu.my/index.php/MJCS/article/view/28581, Retrieved from; Sangeeta, S., Sharma, K., New failure rate model for iterative software development life cycle process (2021) Autom Softw Eng, 28, p. 9; Parizi, R., Prestes, M., Marczak, S., Conte, T., How has design thinking being used and integrated into software development activities?

Understanding how to co-create digital services with users, whether they are customers or future customers. This ability combines observation, dialogue, and iterative experimentation. The approach proposed in this book is based on the Lean Startup approach, according to an extended vision that combines Design Thinking and Growth Hacking. Companies must become truly ""customer-centric"", from observation and listening to co-development. The revolution of the digital age of the 21st century is that customer orientation is more imperative -- the era of abundance, usages rate of change, complexity of experiences, and shift of power towards communities -- are easier, using digital tools and digital communities. 2. Developing an information system (IS) that is the backbone of the digital transformation - called ""exponential information system"" to designate an open IS (in particular on its borders), capable of interfacing and combining with external services, positioned as a player in software ecosystems and built for processing scalable and dynamic data flows. The exponential information system is constantly changing and it continuously absorbs the best of information processing technology, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 3. Building software ""micro-factories"" that produce service platforms, which are called ""Lean software factories."" This ""software factory"" concept covers the integration of agile methods, tooling and continuous integration and deployment practices, a customer-oriented product approach, and a platform approach based on modularity, as well as API-based architecture and openness to external stakeholders. This software micro-factory is the foundation that continuously produces and provides constantly evolving services. These three capabilities are not unique or specific to this book, they are linked to other concepts such as agile methods, product development according to lean principles, software production approaches such as CICD (continuous integration and deployment) or DevOps. This book weaves a common frame of reference for all these approaches to derive more value from the digital transformation and to facilitate its implementation. The title of the book refers to the ""lean approach to digital transformation"" because the two underlying frameworks, Lean Startup and Lean Software Factory, are directly inspired by Lean, in the sense of the Toyota Way. The Lean approach is present from the beginning to the end of this book -- it provides the framework for customer orientation and the love of a job well done, which are the conditions for the success of a digital transformation. © 2022 Yves Caseau.

The focus is to optimize the conventional threat modeling approach to explore software system vulnerabilities. Data produced in the software development processes are better leveraged using Machine Learning approaches. A large amount of industry knowledge around security vulnerabilities can be leveraged to enhance current threat modeling approaches. Work done here is in the ecosystem of software development processes that use Agile methodology. Insurance business domain data are explored as a target for this study. The focus is to enhance the traditional threat modeling approach with a better quantitative approach and reduce the biases introduced by the people who are part of software development processes. This effort will help bridge multiple data sources prevalent across the software development ecosystem. Bringing these various data sources together will assist in understanding patterns associated with security aspects of the software systems. This perspective further helps to understand and devise better controls. Approaches explored so far have considered individual areas of software development and their influence on improving security. There is a need to build an integrated approach for a total security solution for the software systems. A wide variety of machine learning approaches and ensemble approaches will be explored. The insurance business domain is considered for the research here. CWE (Common Weaknesses Enumeration) mapping from industry knowledge are leveraged to validate the security needs from the industry perspective. This combination of industry and company data will help get a holistic picture of the software system's security. Combining the industry and company data helps lay down the path for an integrated security management system in software development. The risk management framework with the quantitative threat modeling process is the work's uniqueness. This work contributes toward making the software systems secure and robust with time. © 2013 IEEE.","integrated security management system; machine learning; quantitative risk assessment; Quantitative threat modeling; software security","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer software; Ecosystems; Insurance; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Security of data; Software design; And integrated security management system; Machine-learning; Quantitative risk assessment; Quantitative threat modeling; Risks management; Security; Security management systems; Software; Software security; Software-systems; Threat modeling; Risk management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eapen, N.G., Rao, A.R., Samanta, D., Robert, N.R., Krishnamoorthy, R., Lokesh, G.H., Security aspects for mutation testing in mobile applications (2022) Cyber Intelligence and Information Retrieval (Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems), pp. 17-27. , J.

However, this prioritization of efficiency and speed has neglected the well-being of the most important element of any project: The teams. This article presents NEKO as a super-Agile methodology focused on people and that aims to prioritize the mental health of workers without neglecting effectiveness, relying on new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence to enhance its processes. During the research stage, using the methodology proposed by Kitchenham, fifteen articles were analyzed and allowed us to rescue the strengths and identify the problems presented by the agile methodologies most used today. Then, the proposal was developed dividing it into three phases; each including events, artifacts, and tools to achieve your goal. Later, during the discussion, the proposal was contrasted with the methodologies initially analyzed and it was concluded that taking the points in favor of these and adding state-of-The-Art technology focused on the well-being of the teams is synonymous with efficiency, meaning a possible change in the paradigm of the current world of work. © 2022 IEEE.","Agile project management; Effectiveness; Mental health; Methodology; Work teams","Agile manufacturing systems; Human resource management; Project management; Agile Methodologies; Agile project management; Effectiveness; Mental health; Methodology; Prioritization; Rapid response; Well being; Work efficiency; Work team; Efficiency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mnookin, S., Out of the Shadows: Making Mental Health a Global Development Priority (2016) Ecosyst.

Here we present an integrated approach to the digitalization of an O&G plant aiming to offer operator safety enhancement, production optimization and reduction of the environmental impact to maximize the asset value. This has been accomplished by complex and continuous work powered by the people who are the engine and the real target of the digital transformation process. In the key study hereby presented, an all-round effort has been made to empower the operator's everyday work with digital and innovative tools supporting reservoir, maintenance, production and HSE workflow. Starting from a number of various legacy systems, a single integrated dashboard was built: The Integrated Operation Centre (IOC). IOC is now available on PC and smartphones to all site personnel both at the operational and managerial level. New innovative systems were developed and deployed into IOC to capitalize on the data acquired during years of plant activities. Machine learning and advanced analytics solutions provide new daily insight on how to efficiently schedule maintenance operations and avoid off-specs and downtime on critical equipment, while complex production optimizers help technicians react to unexpected situations and maximize production. Via IoT (Internet of Things) and portable devices, new tools and workflows were deployed onsite to ease the work and enhance the safety of workers with focus on usage of PPE and providing rapid information to locate workers during emergency situations. People from both site and company headquarters ensured the success of the digital transformation by working together in an Agile Method during the development phase and by coaching in the roll-out phase. New professional roles, like data scientist and big data engineers, joined effort with experienced operators to ensure the success of this journey. This cooperation was at the basis of a comprehensive change management effort, which ensured a smooth and constant change in the way the personnel thinks, acts and reacts. This, we believe, is at the very heart of any fundamental transformation, being it digital or not.

It is basic to give as exact a gauge as could really be expected. Today, in the data innovation business, for assessment in spry programming advancement, most of the part is dependent on heuristic methodologies like master judgment and arranging poker. It is very hard to gauge coordinated programming advancement without nimble mastery. Various studies have been done throughout the years to evaluate software effort estimating methodologies, but because of the rise of new software development processes, the reviews have not been caught up with them. This article gives an intensive assessment of cost assessment in agile software development, which will help the clients in understanding current expense assessment drifts in ASD. Most agile teams estimate software development effort using expert estimating methodologies, according to a thorough literature analysis and survey. This work includes a thorough literature review that has been updated by examining data from 73 new studies. The majority of the data comes from single-company databases; however, cross-company data is extremely popular. Estimates of effort and cost are typically based on the findings of a study using models or historical data applied to size, activities, and other planning characteristics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Agile software development; Artificial intelligence; Cost; Effort; Estimation; Machine learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fernández-Diego, M., Méndez, E.R., González-Ladrón-de-guevara, F., Abrahão, S., Insfran, E., An update on effort estimation in agile software development: A systematic literature review (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 166768-166800; Trendowicz, A., Jeffery, R., (2014) Software Project Effort Estimation: Foundations and Best Practice Guidelines for Success, , Springer, Berlin, Germany; Garg, S., Gupta, D., PCA based cost estimation model for agile software development projects (2015) 2015 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM).

Conversational agents or chatbots reflect a unique opportunity to target those affected online by providing psychoeducation and coping skills, thus filling the gap in service provision. Objective: A world-first body image chatbot called “KIT” was designed. The aim of this study was to assess preliminary acceptability and feasibility via the collection of qualitative feedback from young people and parents/carers regarding the content, structure, and design of the chatbot, in accordance with an agile methodology strategy. The chatbot was developed in collaboration with Australia’s national eating disorder support organization, the Butterfly Foundation. Methods: A conversation decision tree was designed that offered psychoeducational information on body image and eating disorders, as well as evidence-based coping strategies. A version of KIT was built as a research prototype to deliver these conversations. Six focus groups were conducted using online semistructured interviews to seek feedback on the KIT prototype. This included four groups of people seeking help for themselves (n=17; age 13-18 years) and two groups of parents/carers (n=8; age 46-57 years). Participants provided feedback on the cartoon chatbot character design, as well as the content, structure, and design of the chatbot webchat. Results: Thematic analyses identified the following three main themes from the six focus groups: (1) chatbot character and design, (2) content presentation, and (3) flow. Overall, the participants provided positive feedback regarding KIT, with both young people and parents/carers generally providing similar reflections. The participants approved of KIT’s character and engagement. Specific suggestions were made regarding the brevity and tone to increase KIT’s interactivity. Conclusions: Focus groups provided overall positive qualitative feedback regarding the content, structure, and design of the body image chatbot. Incorporating the feedback of lived experience from both individuals and parents/carers allowed the refinement of KIT in the development phase as per an iterative agile methodology. Further research is required to evaluate KIT’s efficacy. ©Francesca Beilharz, Suku Sukunesan, Susan L Rossell, Jayashri Kulkarni, Gemma Sharp.","Artificial intelligence; Body image; Chatbot; Conversational agent; Design; Digital health; Eating disorder; Mental health","acceptance and commitment therapy; adolescent; adult; Article; body image; caregiver; clinical article; cognitive behavioral therapy; comparative study; controlled study; coping behavior; decision tree; eating disorder; female; help seeking behavior; human; information processing; male; mental health service; middle aged; parent; personal experience; positive feedback; psychoeducation; qualitative research; semi structured interview; skill; thematic analysis; child parent relation; Adolescent; Body Image; Caregivers; Focus Groups; Humans; Middle Aged; Parents; Qualitative Research",,,,,"National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC: GNT1146033","The authors would like to thank the focus group participants for their valuable participation and for sharing their lived experience, and Dr Sally Bradford for her invaluable support in the earliest stages of this project.

Objective: Although a myriad of research exists on software analytics as well as on Agile software development (ASD) practice on itself, there exists no systematic overview of the research done on ASD from a data analytics perspective. Therefore, the objective of this work is to make progress by linking ASD with Big Data analytics (BDA). Method: As the primary method to find relevant literature on the topic, we performed manual search and snowballing on papers published between 2011 and 2019. Results: In total, 88 primary studies were selected and analyzed. Our results show that BDA is employed throughout the whole ASD lifecycle. The results reveal that data-driven software development is focused on the following areas: code repository analytics, defects/bug fixing, testing, project management analytics, and application usage analytics. Conclusions: As BDA and ASD are fast-developing areas, improving the productivity of software development teams is one of the most important objectives BDA is facing in the industry. This study provides scholars with information about the state of software analytics research and the current trends as well as applications in the business environment. Whereas, thanks to this literature review, practitioners should be able to understand better how to obtain actionable insights from their software artifacts and on which aspects of data analytics to focus when investing in such initiatives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agile software development; Artificial intelligence; Data analytics; Literature review; Machine learning; Software analytics","Advanced Analytics; Application programs; Big data; Data Analytics; Life cycle; Project management; Software testing; Agile software development; Business environments; Development cycle; Literature reviews; Software artifacts; Software development process; Software development teams; Systematic mapping studies; Software design",,,,,"Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR; Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital, Gobierno de España, MINECO: TIN2016-79269-R","This work is supported in part by the Catalan Agencia de Gestión de Ayudas Universitarias y de Investigación (AGAUR) through the FI Ph.D. grant.

This system mainly used the ESP32 IoT development board as its brain. The researchers developed i-Detect project to provide home automation in smart lighting and switching, smoke and fire detection and mitigation systems that will contribute to disaster risk reduction and management. The project uses a water-scrum-fall approach under agile methodology in developing the system since it involves integration between hardware and software. During the tests conducted in three (3) trials, the results were successful because it performed according to the intended function. The voice-activated home automation carried the commands accordingly; the exhaust fans activated when smoke/gas was detected, and water pumps activated when a fire was detected. It was observed that as long as the internet connection is stable the home automation will successfully execute. On the other hand, the smoke/gas and fire detection and mitigation can still be executed without relying on the internet connection. SMS notifications were also responsive as well as the real-time responsive web server. For a better upgrade of this system, the researchers recommend a better Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design that is ready for mass production. © 2021 IEEE.","Arduino Home Automation; Artificial Intelligence (AI); ESP32; Internet of Things (IoT)","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Fire detectors; Fires; Printed circuit boards; Smoke; Speech recognition; Arduino home automation; Artificial intelligence; ESP32; Fire detection systems; Fire mitigation; Home automation; Internet connection; Internet of thing; Mitigation systems; Smoke detection; Internet of things",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jamadagni, S., Sankpal, P., Patil, S., Chougule, N., Gurav, S., Gas leakage and fire detection using Raspberry Pi (2019) 2019 3rd International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication (ICCMC), pp. 495-497. , Erode, India; Carducci, C.G.C., Monti, A., Schraven, M.H., Schumacher, M., Mueller, D., Enabling ESP32-based IoT applications in building automation systems (2019) 2019 Ii Workshop on Metrology for Industry 4.0 and IoT (MetroInd4.0&IoT), pp. 306-311. , Naples, Italy; Kodali, R.K., Greeshma, R.N.V., Nimmanapalli, K.P., Borra, Y.K.Y., IOT based industrial plant safety gas leakage detection system (2018) 2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation (ICCCA), pp. 1-5. , Greater Noida, India; Mittal, Y., Toshniwal, P., Sharma, S., Singhal, D., Gupta, R., Mittal, V.K., A voice-controlled multi-functional smart home automation system (2015) 2015 Annual Ieee India Conference (INDICON), pp. 1-6. , New Delhi; Listyorini, T., (2018) A Prototype Fire Detection Implemented Using the Internet of Things and Fuzzy Logic; Ryu, C.S., IoT-based intelligent for fire emergency response systems (2015) International Journal of Smart Home, 9, pp. 161-168; Sneha Matriaya, R.P., Voice controlled home automation using amazon echo dot (2018) Iosr Journal of Computer Engineering (IOSR-JCE), 20 (3), pp. 16-19; Yue, C.Z., Ping, S., Voice activated smart home design and implementation (2017) 2017 2nd International Conference on Frontiers of Sensors Technologies (ICFST), pp. 489-492. , Shenzhen; Gandhi, B., Sheth, K., (2019) Systems and Methods to Seamlessly Connect Internet of Things (IoT) Devices to Multiple Intelligent Voice Assistants, , Sep, Patent No. US20190295547.

In the software development domain, an agile method named continuous integration is widely used to automatically integrate code changes from different developers into the same software. Then, each new build can be tested to make sure that the modifications did not interfere with the rest of the already verified code. Despite being very important, regression tests are usually the costliest part of a project. It is laborious to retest all tests of each new software version due to the time it takes to perform and often, before all tests are finished, a new software version is ready to be tested. To improve regression tests results, a selection can be done. By selecting the right tests at the right moment, the use of all test catalogs can be avoided to find faults in the software tested. The aim of this work is to develop a method to select tests to be executed for each version using artificial intelligence algorithms. Learning algorithms can find patterns and similarities between test cases to help knowing which one has a higher probability to expose a fault. © 2021 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Continuous Integration; industrial case study; regression tests; testing","Artificial intelligence; Integration; Integration testing; Regression analysis; Testing; Agile Methodologies; Agile methods; Breakings; Code changes; Continuous integrations; Industrial case study; New builds; Regression tests; Software versions; Test selection; Software design",,,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This project has received funding from Renault Group.

Coupling this framework with the principle of security as a shared responsibility further enhances the efficacy of an integrated Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) Team within organizations to deliver secured digital solutions. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved through multi-year, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts - in terms of new capabilities - in constant investment decision planning cycles, costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this automation evolution vision for ANSPs.This paper examines the migration from today's systems to secure, cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations, like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that must be considered for this evolution. © 2021 IEEE.","ATM; Automation; Cloud-native; Microservices","Air navigation; Air traffic control; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Complex networks; Cost reduction; Data integration; Integration; Integration testing; Interoperability; Safety engineering; Sustainable development; Agile Methodologies; Air navigation service providers; Air Traffic Management; Airspace management; Automation solutions; Automation systems; Cloud-native; Machine-learning; Microservice; Rapid application development; Application programs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A future-ready framework for nas modernization (2021) The Journal of Air Traffic Control, 63 (1), pp. 18-19; (2018) Proposals for the Further Development of the GANP, , ICAO WP/35, ICAO, Thirteenth Air Navigation Conference, October; (2020) FAA's Competitive Award Proactices Expose Its Major Program Contracts to Cost and Performance Risks, , Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Inspector General (OIG), March; (2020) FAA Automation Evolution Strategy-A Key Element for the Future Vision [Video], , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaPkXQiwnys, Mitre Corporation, December 10, YouTube; (2019) SWIM Users Forum [PowerPoint Slides], , https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/swim/users_forum/media/SWIM%20Users%20Forum%2025%20Briefing.pdf, SWIM Program Office, Retrieved from Federal Aviation Administration; Bakshi, K., Microservices-based software architecture and approaches (2017) 2017 IEEE Aerospace Conference, pp. 1-8; https://software.af.mil/team/platformone/, Platform One.

One proposed solution to improve governmental digital service development is for governments to utilize agile development methods. However, there is currently a lack of understanding on two important and related topics. First, whether or not agile development might help to overcome common failure reasons of digital government projects. Second, what the challenges and success factors of agile digital government service development are. This paper addresses both of these gaps. By gathering insights from six cases where agile methods were used in the development of new digital services, it identifies five core categories of challenges and success factors encountered when utilizing agile development methods for governmental digital service development: organizational, methodological, end-user-related, technological, and regulatory. Furthermore, based on these findings, it makes initial recommendations on when and how to best use agile methods for digital government service development. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Agile development; Digital government; e-government; Failure; Public administration; Public services","Computer science; Computers; Agile development; Agile development methods; Agile methods; Digital government; Digital services; End users; Success factors; Artificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alleman, G.B., Henderson, M., Seggelke, R., Making agile development work in a government contracting environment-Measuring velocity with earned value (2003) Proceedings of the Agile Development Conference, 2003.

Profit and not-for profit firms, institutions, and organizations, in general, face unique opportunities and threats related to knowledge management. Digital technologies and digital transformation offer a wide array of opportunities for value creation. At the same time, organizations need to foster newer, faster, and more dynamic ways of mobilizing and managing knowledge. Emerging trends, such as artificial intelligence, collective intelligence, agile methodologies, open innovation, and co-creation enable new business models and managerial paradigms that need to be understood and conceptualized. This book offers an extensive overview of the most recent trends in knowledge management and the most advanced theoretical approaches, while, at the same time, providing a wide array of case studies and evidence-based knowledge management practices. It takes into account the interrelation between ICT and knowledge management challenges, in terms of human/non-human interactions, which requires extraordinary organizational change and renewal. Further, the book presents an up-to-date examination of and guidance for the implementation of knowledge management in an era of unprecedented human/non-human interaction. The book conveys the results of more than a decade of research and applied experience in the field of knowledge management carried out by the author. It is intended not only for students and academics but also for managers and practitioners who are interested in deepening their understanding of knowledge and learning. © 2020 Lucia Marchegiani",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acciarini, C., Bolici, F., Marchegiani, L., Pirolo, L., ;

This paper investigates their usage for the undergraduate studies on parallel and distributed computing (PDC). The aim of this analysis is to evaluate their effectiveness, and also to evaluate to which extent we have to go with the knowledge related to PDC at the undergraduate level. Also, we intended to find out the pace in which agile and cyclic learning enforces the best knowledge transfer of PDC concepts. The analysis takes into consideration several courses spread on the entire curricula, students auto-evaluation based on questionnaires, and grade results. The analysis emphasizes the fact that the tendency is to introduce more and more information and this is facilitated by an agile approach, but in the same time this should be moderated if the final goal is to assure also a good and deep understanding of associated knowledge. © 2020 ACM.","agile methodologies; cyclic learning; knowledge levels; parallel and distributed computing; undergraduate studies","Knowledge management; Software engineering; Surveys; Agile approaches; Knowledge transfer; Parallel and distributed computing; Undergraduate study; Artificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2001) Manifesto for Agile Software Development, , https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-Agile-manifesto, Agile Alliance, 2001); Ambler, S.W., Lines, M., An executive's guide to disciplined agile: Winning the race to business agility (2017) CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform.; Bloom, B.S., Engelhart, M.D., Furst, E.J., Hill, W.H., Krathwohl, D.R., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classifcation of Educational Goals.

Considering the effect of major environmental events such as the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, technology has become even more influential. In this context, the very rapid developments in technologies such as cloud computing, internet of things, machine learning, artificial intelligence and 5G and consequently the need for continuous upskilling of expert human resources have made the adaptation of traditional learning and teaching methods to this new human condition a vital issue. While the aforementioned phenomenon is being experienced, a talent gap is observed between the competencies of the graduates of Computer Science Engineering, Software Engineering, Industrial Engineering and other related departments and industry expectations as a result of the traditional education approaches of the universities. The shortening of the lifespan of the produced vocational knowledge day by day continues to increase this gap. For this reason, it has become more important than ever that higher education institutions have an approach that is more suitable for this dynamic environment. In this study, it has been examined whether the agile methods, which have become widespread within software industry in the last 15 years, have similar potential when used as a training method. During the study, 49 students from the engineering faculty of a Turkish University participated in the ""Agile Software and Product Development""course. The curriculum design, learning experiences, student performance considerations and the other results have been shared. In this course, 3 Sprints are designed with 8 Agile Project Teams that are self-organized with the Scrum framework.

For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. Objective: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool’s feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. Methods: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app’s feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura’s model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. Results: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. Conclusions: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness. © Edward Meinert.","Access; Aged; Agile; App; Artificial intelligence; Cellphone; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Data science; Digital health; Evaluation; Exercise; Health care quality; Information science; Mental health; Public reporting of healthcare data; Requirements engineering; Social distancing; Telemedicine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2020) Guidance on social distancing for everyone in the UK, , https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults, Gov.uk.

Strategic innovation involves high uncertainties better addressed through agile methods and a collaborative approach [1–3]. Key success factors in delivering ITO/BPO innovation are high-quality relationships, trust and collaborative cultures [1–4], and establishing an effective governance configuration. The authors report on longitudinal case studies of a global mining company (“GMC”) and a group of its suppliers aimed at understanding how GMC is developing “big data” applications to generate game-changing innovation. This paper describes how GMC has developed a “big data” platform to support internal staff, customers, consultants and third party suppliers to create applications that can transform global mining and smelting industries to deliver a price premium for GMC’s products. GMC has encountered a shortage of suitably experienced data scientists in its key operating locations resulting in a significant skills gap in its big data program. GMC’s sourcing strategy aims to build an open and collaborative ecosystem that draws upon secondary markets to help fill the skills gap. To create an environment in which open innovation [5] can flourish, GMC established an Analytics Speed Team (AST) as an internal consulting and program management group to drive faster progress with big data applications. A contribution of this research is to identify the role of AST in establishing an effective governance configuration for open innovation. A practical contribution is made by analysing the value of secondary markets for ITO services in a sourcing ecosystem optimised for delivering innovation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cloud services; Innovation in outsourcing/offshoring; Secondary markets; Sourcing configuration; Sourcing ecosystem; “Gig” economy","Application programs; Big data; Commerce; Ecosystems; Human resource management; Big data applications; Business process outsourcing; Collaborative approach; Key success factors; Longitudinal case study; Program management group; Sourcing strategies; Strategic innovations; Digital storage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Oshri, I., Kotlarsky, J., Gerbasi, A., Strategic innovation through outsourcing: The role of relational and contractual governance (2015) J.

Companies that offer products or services to people must implement methodologies that facilitate and speed up the development of projects to satisfy the customer. That is, being able to develop their technology products to improve and promote the customer experience. Now, several companies (not software industry exclusive) use agile methodologies since they facilitate their development since it allows them to act quickly in the face of changes in customer requirements. This does not affect the planning and budget. In this project, we proposed a plan to implement the Scrum methodology in the CIB Engineering Area in BBVA Colombia by phases and focus on people's adaptation rather than the process. During this implementation, we observed some factors that caused dissatisfaction in the team, but which were overcome as people understood the purpose and benefits from their own experience. In addition to getting team members to play a role and follow the framework's rules, our highest satisfaction is that most of the team, after two iterations, is willing to transform the way they have been doing their job. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Agile; Digital transformation; Good practices; Scrum","Budget control; Customer satisfaction; International trade; Sales; Software engineering; Agile Methodologies; Customer experience; Customer requirements; Scrum methodologies; Software industry; Team members; Technology products; World market; Artificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barrientos, G.

Model and its transformation is a key factor of software project process. This can be adapted by using some new transformation language. This paper aims to convert a class diagram (CLD) to Relational Schema (RS). Which include different perspective like, blocks, fitness function, and algorithm. Model transformation contribute major role in Model Driven Engineering (MDE). So transformation is perspective for the agile software development methodology. Transformation is part of agile methodology, which makes a better result for whole transformation process. For the same different algorithm are requiring for calculating the concern value for fitness function. This research work refer a optimization algorithm for phase 1 and phase 2 module and try to get a better output as compare to other algorithm like DA, PSO, ADF. This work will consider the Ant Colony optimization (ACO) algorithm integrated with dragonfly algorithm (ACADF) for the model transformation. These model transformations also consider the fitness function accordingly. Further it evaluate and analyzed using Automatic correctness (AC) and related fitness function, which pave the blocks for better result. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ant colony; Class diagram; Dragonfly; Model transformation; Model-driven engineering; Optimization; Relational schema; TDD","Artificial intelligence; Engineering research; Health; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Project management; Software design; Ant colonies; Class diagrams; Dragonfly; Model transformation; Model-driven Engineering; Relational schemas; Ant colony optimization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sendall, S., Kozaczynski, W., Model transformation: The heart and soul of model-driven software development (2003) IEEE Softw, 20 (5), pp. 42-45; Rahim, L.A., Whittle, J., A survey of approaches for verifying model transformations (2015) Softw Model, 14 (2), pp. 1003-1028; Ehrig, H., Ehrig, K., Taentzer, G., (2006) Fundamentals of Algebraic Graph Transformation, , Monographs in Computer Science; (2018) OCL 2.4 Specification, , http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/2.4/; Cuadrado, J.S., Esther, G., Lara, J., Static analysis of model transformations (2017) IEEE Trans on Softw Eng, 43 (9), pp. 868-897; Jouault, F., Allilaire, F., Bézivin, J., Kurtev, I., ATL: A model transformation tool (2008) Sci Comput Program, 72 (1), pp. 31-39; Czarnecki, K., Helsen, S., Feature-based survey of model transformation approaches (2006) IBM Syst J, 45 (3), pp. 621-645; Schmidt, D., Model-driven engineering (2006) IEEE Comput, 39 (2), pp. 25-31; Fleck, M., Troya, J., Kessentini, M., Wimmer, M., Alkhazi, B., Model transformation modular-ization as a many-objective optimization problem (2017) IEEE Trans Softw Eng, 43 (11), pp. 1009-1032; Gammaitoni, L., Kelsen, P., Ma, Q., Agile validation of model transformations using compound F-Alloy specifications (2018) Sci Comput Program, 162, pp. 55-75; Liu, X., Yu, Y., Zhen, L., Herbert, H.C., Iu, T.F., An efficient algorithm for optimally reshaping the TP model transformation (2017) IEEE Trans Circ Syst II, 64 (10), pp. 1187-1191; Cuadrado, J.S., Guerra, E., Lara, J., A component model for model transformations (2014) IEEE Trans Softw Eng, 40 (11), pp. 1042-1060; Kessentini, M., Sahraoui, H., Boukadoum, M., Ben, O., Search-based model transformation by example (2012) Softw Syst Model, 11 (2), pp. 209-226; Blum, C., Ant colony optimization: Introduction and recent trends (2005) Phys Life Rev, 2 (4), pp. 353-373; http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Ant_colony_optimization; Kessentini, M., Boukadoum, H., Omar, O., Search-based model transformation by example (2012) S/W & Syst Model, 11 (2), pp. 209-226; Jadhav, P.P., Joshi, S., Fractional Weightage Based Objective Function to Hybrid Optimization Algorithm for Model Transformation, Evolutionary Intelligence, , Springer; ISSN-1864-5909; Ko, J.W., Beak, S., Song, Y., Model optimization with graph transformation and PSO algorithm for model transformation verification (2012) Proceedings of International Conference on IT Convergence and Security, 120, p. 2012. , , vol","Jadhav, P.P.; Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed to Be University) College of EngineeringIndia; email: ppjadhav21@gmail.com","Kumar A.Mozar S.",,"Springer Verlag","2nd International Conference on Communications and Cyber-Physical Engineering, ICCCE 2019","1 February 2019 through 2 February 2019",,229409,18761100,9789811387142,,,"English","Lect.

Thus, knowledge dissemination/acquisition becomes difficult because of the four inherent distances in GSD, which, in turn causes AK vaporization. One way to reduce this loss of knowledge is to take advantage of the AK traces that different unstructured and textual electronic means (UTEM) leave (e.g. instant messengers and email), which developers prefer on AGSD environments. These traces are valuable, but their access is difficult because these means have no tools adapted to search AK and because this knowledge is scattered in different UTEM. The AK condensation concept proposes that trough a mechanism of classification and collection of messages contained in UTEM, AK could become available for the stakeholders. This article presents a Slack complement, which implements an AK classification mechanism based on social tagging. We evaluated this mechanism with undergraduate students through a replica of a previous study. We obtained positive results in regards to usefulness and ease of use, but with tagging behavior results that differ (not statistically significant) from those obtained previously. These evidences encourage us to evaluate the AK condensation concept in its whole, in real scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.","Agile and global software development; Architectural knowledge condensation; Architectural knowledge management; Social tagging","Artificial intelligence; Software design; Students; Architectural knowledge; Classification mechanism; Global software development; Instant messengers; Knowledge classification; Knowledge dissemination; Social tagging; Undergraduate students; Condensation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Holmstrom, H., Conchuir, E.O., Agerfalk, P.J., Fitzgerald, B., Global software development challenges: A case study on temporal, geographical and socio-cultural distance (2006) Glob.

The study focuses on creating a platform that would be able to capture the data in the form of comments or reviews. The platform was able to create and generate quantitative and text data based on the reviews and comments. The researchers used the Scrum Agile methodology. This study utilized the descriptive research method with the use of the questionnaire as the instrument testing the acceptability of the system's application. It was evaluated by 100 respondents. The mean value was determined and compared using analysis of variance to determine if there is a significant difference. ANOVA was also used to test for critical value of the null hypothesis. Based on the results, there is a marked significant difference among the evaluation of the 4 groups of respondents as indicated in the F-value of 6.48972. The respondents gave an acceptable rating and all agreed that the proposed product sentiment analysis application is a useful tool in evaluating company's products. © 2019 IEEE.","analytics; mining; opinion; product review; sentiment analysis","Artificial intelligence; Instrument testing; Mining; Agile Methodologies; analytics; Critical value; Customer products; Null hypothesis; opinion; Product reviews; research methods; Sentiment analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Joleta, C., (2018) Ontology-Based Opinion Mining, , IGI Global; Mantyla, M., Graziotin, D., Kuutila, M., The evolution of sentiment analysis-A review of research topics, venues, and top cited papers (2018) Computer Science Review, 27, pp. 16-32. , February; Hamad, A., Petri, I., Rezgui, Y., Kwan, A., Towards the innovation of an integrated one-stop-shop' online services utility management: Exploring customer' technology acceptance (2017) Sustaianble Cities and Society, 34, pp. 126-143. , October; Poirson, E., Da Cunha, C., A recommender approach based on customer emotions (2019) Expert Systems with Applications, 122, pp. 281-288. , May; Do, H., Prasad, P., Maag, A., Alsadoon, A., Deep learning for aspect-based sentiment analysis: A comparative review (2019) Expert Systems with Applications, 118, pp. 272-299. , March; Whitehead, M., Yaeger, L., (2008) Sentiment Mining Using Ensemble Classification Models; Benamara, F., Cesarano, C., Reforgiato, D., Sentiment analysis: Adjectives and adverbs are better than adjectives alone (2007) Proceedings of International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 1-7; Sultana, N., Kumar, P., Patra, R.M., Chandra, S., Alam, S.K.S., Sentiment analysis for product review (2019) ICTACT Journal on Soft Computing, 9 (3). , April; Vinodhini, G., Chandrasekaran, R., Opinion mining using principal component analysis bases ensemble model for e-commerce application (2014) CSIT, , November; Fang, X., Zhan, J., Sentiment analysis using product review data Retrieved from SpringOpen, , https://journalofbigdataspringeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-015-0015-2",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2019 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Knowledge Economy, ICCIKE 2019","11 December 2019 through 12 December 2019",,157936,,9781728137780,,,"English","Proc.

In order to design and propose quality-oriented apps, it is the primary responsibility of the developers to devote time and sufficient efforts towards testing to make the Apps bug free and operational in the hands of end users without any hiccup. In order to test the mobile apps, manual testing procedures takes prolonged amount of time in writing test cases and even the full testing requirements are not met. In addition to this, lack of sufficient knowledge by the tester also impacts overall quality and assurance that app is bug free. To overcome all the issues of testing, and to assure that apps designed by developers are almost bug free, we propose a new testing methodology cum tool 'AgileUATM' which works primarily towards white-box and black-box testing. With this tool, all the test cases are generated automatically based on user stories and acceptance criteria by using formal specification and Z3 SMT solvers. To test the validity of the proposed tool, we applied the tool in real-time operational environment with regard to test Mobile apps. Using this tool, all the acceptance criteria is determined via user stories. The testers/developers specify requirements with formal specifications based on programs properties, predicates, invariants, and constraints. From the results, it is observed that the proposed tool i.e. AgileUATM generated effective and accurate test cases, test input, and expected output was generated in a unified fashion from the user stories to meet acceptance criteria. In addition to this, the tool also reduced the development time to identify test data as compared to manual Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodologies. With this tool, the developers got better idea with regard to required tests and able to translate the customers natural languages to the computer language as well. © 2019 IEEE.","Acceptance Criteria; Agile Methodology; AgileUATM; BDD; Mobile Application Testing; Model Inference; Test Generation; User story","Artificial intelligence; Automatic test pattern generation; Black-box testing; Formal specification; Mobile computing; Acceptance criteria; Explosive growth; Mobile application development; Mobile applications; Natural languages; Operational environments; Testing methodology; Testing requirements; Acceptance tests",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Annie, A., App Annie mobile app forecast: The path to $100 billion (2016) App Annie; Heuveldop, N., (2017) Ericssson Mobility Report; Arzensek, B., Heriko, M., Criteria for selecting mobile application testing tools (2014) Third Workshop on Software Quality Analysis, Monitoring, Improvement and Applications SQAMIA 2014; Rajasekaran, M.J., Challenges in mobile application testing: A survey (2016) IJCTA, 9 (27), pp. 159-163; Akour, M., Al-Zyoud, A.A., Falah, B., Bouriat, S., Alemerien, K., Mobile software testing: Thoughts, strategies, challenges, and experimental study (2016) InT.

For this purpose, we have applied an agile methodology to be able to produce a driving and pedestrian simulation system as a serious game, which includes a three-layer hierarchical architecture (orientation layer, management layer, and control layer). This architecture can be used to simulate three environments that are: a) Driver's environment; b) Pedestrian environment; c) Vehicle traffic observer environment. All these environments are controlled by intelligent agents that allow the user to handle the autonomous longitudinal control, the relative distance, the speed of the cars, the collisions between vehicles, the pedestrian collision, excess of the speed limit, circulation in the opposite direction, and respect of traffic signals. Our solution to traffic problems has been validated by the execution of several tests in public schools, and the results demonstrate that this simulation application encourages learning in road safety education for children between 9 and 12 years old, using a distributed environment with a computational cluster in the cloud. © 2019 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; driving simulator; pedestrian simulation; road safety education.; serious 3D game","Artificial intelligence; Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Intelligent agents; Longitudinal control; Motor transportation; Pedestrian safety; Roads and streets; Street traffic control; Traffic signals; 3D games; Computational cluster; Distributed environments; Driving simulator; Hierarchical architectures; Pedestrian simulation; Road safety; Simulation applications; Serious games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2018) The Top 10 Causes of Death, , World Health Organization (WOH), [Online]; (2018) La Seguridad Vial Es Responsabilidad de Todos, , El Telégrafo [On line]; García, J., Naranjo, L., Vélez, D., Chaves, R., Bonilla, D., Tenesaca, F., Anuario de Estadística de Transporte 2016, , Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos-INEC; Reforma Creará Cátedra de Educación Vial en Colegios, , El Telégrafo; Currículo de EGB y BGU (2016) Ciencias Sociales Gobierno de la República Del Ecuador, , Ministerio de Educación, [Online]; Pfeffer, K., Howat, R., (2007) Using a Driving Simulator to Evaluate a Road Safety Education Programme for Young Drivers""; Filtness, A., Tones, M., Bates, L., Watson, B., Williamson, A., Simulators for skill acquisition training ans assessment, and their impact on road safety"" (2013) The Centre for Accident Research and Safety, , November; Vlakveld, W., Will simulator training in basic driver education help to enhance road safety (2006) SWOV Omstitute for Road Safety Research, , January; Monclús González, J., Nicolás Jaramillo, D., Planes Estratégicos Europeos de Seguridad Vial (2015) Propuestas de Acción en España, Fundación MAPFRE, , Abril; (2015) Pedagogía y Psicología Aplicada a la Conducción, , Dirección General de Tráfico (DGT).

As the number of non-technical business professionals who want to improve their participation in technical discussions is increasing, it becomes important to find effective teaching methods for non-technical adults who need to understand core technical concepts in which they are involved reasonably. The proposed teaching method utilizes the active use of visual feedback and agile practices to overcome the challenges the adult learners face. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed teaching method by the open coding method to analyze the free-form responses and by the paired t-test over the responses to the questions asked to the participants before and after the lecture. We found that this teaching method effectively supported the learners to understand the basic technical concepts of AI within one or two-day time frame. We also confirmed the non-technical adult learners had significantly changed their attitude toward understanding AI from initially negative to positive with a good expectation of success in understanding AI, which is one of the important outcomes for the learners as the expectancy-value theory predicts their future performance on understanding AI. © 2019 IEEE.","adult learners; agile method; artificial intelligence; programming; storytelling; technology education; visual method","Artificial intelligence; Information dissemination; Mathematical programming; Teaching; Visual communication; Adult learners; Agile methods; storytelling; Technology education; visual method; Learning systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Guo, P.J., Older adults learning computer programming: Motivations, frustrations, and design opportunities (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems-CHI'17, pp. 7070-7083. , Denver, Colorado, USA; Chilana, P.K., Perceptions of non-cs majors in intro programming: The rise of the conversational programmer (2015) 2015 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), pp. 251-259. , Atlanta, GA; Chilana, P.K., Singh, R., Guo, P.J., Understanding conversational programmers: A perspective from the software industry, "" in proceedings of the (2016) 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems-CHI'16, pp. 1462-1472. , Santa Clara, California, USA; Wang, A.Y., Mitts, R., Guo, P.J., Chilana, P.K., Mismatch of expectations: How modern learning resources fail conversational programmers (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems-CHI'18, pp. 1-13. , Montreal QC, Canada; Bosse, Y., Gerosa, M.A., Why is programming so difficult to learn?: Patterns of difficulties related to programming learning mid-stage (2017) SIGSOFT Softw Eng Notes, 41 (6), pp. 1-6. , Jan; Butler, M., Morgan, M., Learning Challenges Faced by Novice Programming Students Studying High Level and Low Feedback Concepts, p. 9; Wigfield, A., Eccles, J.S., Expectancy-value theory of achievement motivation (2000) Contemp.

These user stories are then scoped in various sprint releases and delivered accordingly. Release planning in Agile becomes challenging when the number of user stories goes up in hundreds. In such scenarios it is very difficult to manually identify similar user stories and package them together into a release. Hence, this paper suggests application of natural language processing algorithms for identifying similar user stories and then scoping them into a release This paper takes the approach to build a word corpus for every project release identified in the project and then to convert the provided user stories into a vector of string using Java utility for calculating top 3 most occurring words from the given project corpus in a user story. Once all the user stories are represented as vector array then by using RV coefficient NLP algorithm the user stories are clustered into various releases of the software project. Using the proposed approach, the release planning for large and complex software engineering projects can be simplified resulting into efficient planning in less time. The automated commercial tools like JIRA and Rally can be enhanced to include suggested algorithms for managing release planning in Agile. © 2019 IEEE.","Agile Methodology; Algorithm; Natural Language Processing; R Programming; Release Planning; Software Engineering","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Linguistics; Software engineering; Agile Methodologies; Commercial tools; Complex software; Efficient planning; NAtural language processing; R programming; Release planning; Software project; Natural language processing systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amjad, S., Ahmad, N., Saba, T., Anjum, A., Manzoor, U., Balubaid, M.A., Malik, S.R., Calculating completeness of agile scope in scaled agile development (2018) IEEE Special Section on Software Standards and Their Impact in Reducing Software Failures Digital Object Identifier, 6; Pollock, L., Binkley, D., Lawrie, D., Hill, E., Oliveto, R., Bavota, G., Bacchelli, A., 1st international workshop on natural language analysis in software engineering (2013) NaturaLiSE; Sonia, H., Venera, A., Andrian, M., Giuliano, A., The use of text retrieval and natural language processing in software engineering 2016 IEEE/ACM 38th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering Companion; Cosh, K., Ramingwong, S., Eiamkanitchat, N., Ramingwong, L., (2018) Automatically Identifying Themes and Trends in Software Engineering Research, , 978-1-5386-4015/18/$31. 00@IEEE; Van Kennedy, Z.V.D.J., Software language identification with natural language classifiers 2016 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering; Rui, S., Deming, Z., Translating software requirement from natural language to automaton (2013) 2013 International Conference on Mechatronic Sciences, Electric Engineering and Computer (MEC), , Shenyang, China Dec 20-22; (2010) The A-Z of Programming Languages: Modula-3.

Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, Blockchain, Data Analytics, Big Data, Robotics (autonomous vehicles, drones, RPA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Digital Twins, AR/VR has catalyzed this transformation. For instance, the deployment of AI systems to help optimize Bakken Shale wells running on SRP's, implementation of Blockchain drilling for well construction activities, VR/AR visualization of Canada SAGD oilfields, proactive adjustments to ESP using real-time data analytics in Kazakhstan gas condensate wells are some of the recent transformations the industry has witnessed. As the Oil and Gas 4.0 simplifies, modernizing and securing the legacy environments for the new digital era, a robust Digital Assurance is essential. Digital Assurance is an exclusive digital service employing an end-to-end ecosystem approach with intelligent and automated processes to gain quality and speed for promoting faster business, technology change and better customer experience. The service shall offer evaluation of new tools and testing environments such as the cloud, software testing tools, mobile environment, and application performance. Digital Assurance is more than the traditional QA; the evolution of Agile methods with DevOps tools and techniques for software/simulator development and testing has made its deployment quick, safe and reliable. The end-to-end testing process serves to simulate the real user on-field scenarios and validate the system under test and its components for integration and data integrity. Leveraging Digital 2.0 transformations, smart oilfields (by implementing autonomous robots) can eliminate human intervention in potential risk areas and thereby providing a safe, compliant workplace for engineers, managers, crewmembers and other personnel. Especially, robotics has potential applications in inspection, maintenance, and safety operations. In alignment with this, our personalized robotic testing solution can automate various peripheral devices and has resulted in reduced testing cycle time up to 30% and cost by 40%. The solution enables automated end-to-end IoT device interactions spanning smart devices such as camera, thermostat, sensors and web applications in oil and gas facilities. Adding, our various other in-house digital framework and solutions such as Big Data validation framework, cloud-based on-demand testing, and automated test scriptwriters have eased digital transformations. Digital Assurance by rigorous testing practices can also immune oil and gas majors from the cyber threats for the cloud (grid, storage) and blockchain. To overcome such compromises in hardware failure, our smart and innovative IoT Test Workbench solution for integration testing can reduce the hardware dependency up to 100%.

There are mining, metallurgical, petrochemical, timber, woodworking and other industries. Such a developed infrastructure of the economy provides stable needs for qualified specialists-engineers, technologists, power engineering specialists. It is clear that the system of higher and secondary vocational education is aimed at training personnel who are ready to participate in the regional development effectively. The world nowadays lives in the realities of the economy, where digital technologies have already been introduced in both industry and social entrepreneurship. There is enough evidence in the world that the digital economy is one of the most effective tools to increase labor productivity. The economy of any country expects the reduction of costs, the growth of efficiency, the quality of management, the competitiveness from digitalization. Increasingly, we use the terms “big data”, neurotechnology, artificial intelligence, new production technologies, industrial Internet, robotics, sensor technology, wireless communication, virtual and augmented reality in our vocabulary. Moreover, it does not matter whether we are talking about the soil sciences, space research or governmental management. Russia is aimed at the emergence of high-tech enterprises operating in the global market and forming a system of start-ups and research teams that will ensure the development of the economy in the future. Siberian Federal University as one of the largest universities in the country sees its mission in the training of specialists with digital competencies. Understanding the strategy of the state, our university acts as a source of expertise, analytical judgments, scientific discussions, wide dissemination and use of information, information and communication technologies. We have created a team of like-minded people from among the university faculty members, representatives of business and industry, who are ready for change. The purpose of the article is to present the authors’ experience in the development of the project in the form of the concept of a new Master’s educational program for the training of highly qualified specialists in the field of applied Informatics, ready for development, implementation and adaptation of information technologies of various industry directions. The goal is achieved on the basis of competence and system approaches. The research methodology is based on the use of analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, including phenomenological description, survey, included observation, Agile-methodology. The result of the team’s activity in the form of the developed concept will have a strong motivational effect both on the labor market and on the university applicants. To the first, it gives the opportunity to feel the involvement in the training of specialists in demand, to understand own value, the importance of it. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

It involves problem solving, domain understanding and communication skills as well as knowledge of a broad variety of technologies, architectures, and solution approaches. As such, software development projects include many situations where crucial decisions must be made. Making the appropriate organizational or technical choices for a given software team building a product can make the difference between project success or failure. Software development methods have introduced frameworks and sets of best practices for certain contexts, providing practitioners with established guidelines for these important choices. Current Agile methods employed in modern software development have highlighted the importance of the human factors in software development. These methods rely on short feedback loops and the self-organization of teams to enable collaborative decision making. While Agile methods stress the importance of empirical process control, i.e. relying on data to make decisions, they do not prescribe in detail how this goal should be achieved. In this paper, we describe the types and abstraction levels of data and decisions within modern software development teams and identify the benefits that usage of this data enables. We argue that the principles of data-driven decision making are highly applicable, yet underused, in modern Agile software development.

One of the critical factors in the implementation of a SCRUM environment is the set-up of teams that are simultaneously homogeneous and composed of the best collaborators for each SCRUM role. In this sense, this study describes the modeling process and presents the implementation of a decision support system that can contribute to improving the process of assigning an agile team simultaneously considering the technical and social skills of employees. The results of the study allowed testing the application considering different competencies associated to each Agile position, the impact that the attribution process suffers from oscillations in the process of evaluation and self-evaluation, and the impact in terms of the performance of the inclusion of new collaborators and criteria comparison.

Currently, ontology is used in semantic web, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, information systems, knowledge management, etc. The development of ontology involves a structural and logical complexity that is comparable to the development of software artifacts. Therefore, ontology building requires a methodology to ensure its reliability. In this context, there are several methodologies proposed for building ontologies. However, most of the existing methodologies failed to provide sufficient details for the activities and techniques employed in them with a defined ontology lifecycle. To build ontologies that are reliable, long lived and continually adapted, the ontology engineering (OE) should be supported by the software engineering (OE). But, SE was not initially meant to support the development of software artifacts such as ontologies. There is a significant gap between them in terms of popularity and maturity level. The aim of this paper is to bridge this gap by proposing an Agile Methodology for Ontology Development (AMOD). AMOD adopts the agile principles and practices in the ontology development. The final framework of AMOD fits the various ontology activities into the phases of the Scrum agile methodology. It has three phases: pre-game, development and post-game. AMOD was applied to develop ontology for software project time management. Additionally, a compliance analysis of different ontology methodologies with respect to the IEEE Standard was made. Results showed that AMOD resulted in 56% satisfaction for IEEE standard processes. This resembles 22% enhancement in the satisfaction against the other methodologies. © 2019, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.","Knowledge engineering; Ontology; Ontology development;

Agile software development is one of them. Agile is a time-dependent approach to software delivery. Scrum is the agile software development methodology process that is extensively utilized today in many of the software companies. It is an agile technique to handle a project, usually in agile software development. Agile software development by way of Scrum is frequently perceived as a methodology; however than showing Scrum as methodology, consider of it as a framework for handling a process. This paper will initiate with the background, it will cover the characteristics and definition of agile software development and highlights the major different agile software techniques. Various agile techniques will also elaborate in this paper. The core aim of this paper is to identify risk on agile development and improve the quality of the software by using agile methodologies. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Agile software development; Risk management; Scrum; Software development techniques; Traditional software development","Agile manufacturing systems; Artificial intelligence; Human engineering; Risk management; Risk perception; Systems engineering; Agile development; Agile Methodologies; Agile software development; Agile softwares; Scrum; Software company; Software development process; Software development techniques; Software design",,,,,"Lahore University of Management Sciences, LUMS","We authors acknowledge with thanks assistance rendered by Prof. Dr. Javed Anjum Sheikh, University of Lahore, (Gujrat Campus) for providing crucial insight during the course of the research work, which greatly improved the manuscript.",,,,,,,,,,"(2009), http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progarming, Accessed 5 Apr 2009; (2009), http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_oriented, Accessed 20 Mar 2009; Klimes, C., Prochazka, J., (2006) New Approaches in Software Development in Acta Elctrotechnica Et Informatics; Szalvay, V., An introduction to agile software development (2004) Technical Report, Danube Technology; Royce, W., (1998) Software Project Management: A Unified Framework; Ahmed, A., Ahmed, S., Ehsan, N., Mirza, E., Sarwar, S.Z., (2010) Agile Software Development: Impact on Productivity and Quality, pp. 287-290. , IEEE; Kumar, G., Bhatia, P.K., Impact of agile methodology on software development process (2012) IJCTEE, p. 2; Dyba, T., Dingsoyr, T., What do we know about agile software development (2009) IEEE Softw, 26, pp. 6-9; Schawber, K., Beedle, M., (2001) Agile Software Development with Scrum, , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River; Rong, G., Shao, D., SCRUM-PSP: Embracing process agility and discipline (2010) Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference; Begel, A., Nagappan, N., Usage and perceptions of agile software development in an industrial context: An exploratory study (2007) 1St International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, pp. 255-264; Zuo, A., Yang, J., Chen, X., Research of agile software development based on formal methods (2010) International Conference on Multimedia Information Networking and Security, pp. 762-766; Livermore, J.A., (2007) Factors that Impact Implementing an Agile Software Development Mehtodolgy, pp. 82-85. , IEEE; Nakki, P., Koskela, K., Pikkarainen, M., Practical model for user driven innovation in agile software development (2011) Proceedings of the of 17Th International Conference on Concurrent Enterprising, pp. 1-8; Solo, O., Abrahamsson, P., Agile methods in european embedded software development organization: A survey on the actual use and usefulness of extreme programming and scrum (2008) IET Softw, 2 (1), pp. 58-64; Far, B., (2007) Software Reliability Engineering for Agile Software Development, pp. 607-694. , IEEE; Misra, S.C., Kumar, U., Kumar, V., Grant, G., (2006) The Organizational Changes Required and the Challenges Involved in Adopting Agile Methodologies in Traditional Software Development Organization, pp. 25-28. , IEEE; Kohlbacher, M., Stelzmann, E., Maierhofer, S., Do agile software development practices increase customer satisfaction in system engineering porject?

Tight relationship between functional and non-functional will determine the quality of requirements, in which ultimately determines the quality of the software being built. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) often get less attention in the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. In NFR determination, it is necessary to know the attributes and determination criteria that will make easier to determine the relation to FR (Functional Requirements) related. Nowadays many software developers use the Agile Methodology, where the determination of NFR by means of interviews with its stakeholders. Considering the importance of NFR attributes, then the NFR attributes mapping, how to obtain NFR attributes, and how to represent them closely with FR. The research method uses the Prisma Framework. The results of this research determine the NFR attributes domains, identification of NFR attributes, classification of NFR attributes, NFR representation between FR and NFR attributes, are used to obtain application features. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Functional Requirements (FR); NFR attributes; Non-Functional Requirements (NFR); Requirements Engineering (RE)","Artificial intelligence; Multimedia systems; Requirements engineering; Agile Methodologies; Functional requirement; NFR attributes; Non-functional; Nonfunctional requirements; research methods; Software developer; Software requirements; Computer software",,,,,"Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation, University of Pittsburgh, MCSI, PITT","This research funded from the PITTA Grant from the University of Indonesia with grant number 187 / UN2.R3.1 / HKP.05.00 / 2018.",,,,,,,,,,"Sharma, V.S., Ramnani, R.R., Sengupta, S., A framework for identifying and analyzing non-functional requirements from text categories and subject descriptors (2014) TwinPeaks, 14, pp. 1-8. , Hyderabad, India, June 1, 2014; Zamzami, E.M., Budiardjo, E.K., Documenting software requirements specification using R2UC ontology (2012) J.

Among the most popular is the framework of SCRUM (1986), which is characterized by iterations, where in each iteration it is necessary to make a planning, analysis of requirements, design, coding, tests and documentation. The requirements specification in SCRUM is based on the concept of user stories (US), which are the description of a requirement written in one or two sentences using the user's natural language. An important feature of US is that they must be estimable, that is to say, it must be possible to determine the time it will take to complete it. This allows the Scrum Development Team to determine the total time of the project. However in practice, this task still has problems due to the complexity of the requirements and affects the agreement of US in each iteration. In this paper we propose a strategy to classify the US following the taxonomy of Bloom to determine the degree of its complexity and by doing so make an agile estimation of the approximate time that each one requires for its realization. We show the results obtained after the US have been classified from two projects and based on them, we propose strategies to estimate them. © 2017 IEEE.","Agile evaluation; Agile methodologies; Bloom's Taxonomy; SCRUM; User stories","Artificial intelligence; Blooms (metal); Software engineering; Taxonomies; Agile evaluation; Agile Methodologies; Bloom's taxonomy; SCRUM; User stories; Iterative methods",,,,,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Robert Bryce for editing suggestions.

However, there are very few studies on how such projects work in practice. In this paper, we analyze project issues tracking data taken from Scrum (a popular tool for Agile) for several machine learning projects. We compare this data with corresponding data from non-machine learning projects, in an attempt to analyze how machine learning projects are executed differently from normal software engineering projects. On analysis, we find that machine learning project issues use different kinds of words to describe issues, have higher number of exploratory or research oriented tasks as compared to implementation tasks, and have a higher number of issues in the product backlog after each sprint, denoting that it is more difficult to estimate the duration of machine learning project related tasks in advance. After analyzing this data, we propose a few ways in which Agile machine learning projects can be better logged and executed, given their differences with normal software engineering projects. © 2018 IEEE.","agile methodology; machine learning project; scrum; software engineering","Learning systems; Software engineering; Teaching; Agile Methodologies; scrum; Software engineering projects; Tracking data; Machine learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Columbus, L., (2018) Roundup of Machine Learning Forecasts and Market Estimates, , forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/02/18/roundup-of-machine-learning-forecasts-And-market-estimates-2018/#5a32a37d2225, Forbes, Feb [Online].

Most of these devices will communicate wirelessly in a limited spectrum which means that a substantial amount of interferences will be generated. To overcome these interferences, a significant increase in (battery) power consumption is needed to re-transmit packages and to provide a transmit power margin. Hence, this challenge calls for agile methods that can overcome the interferences without wasting power. In this paper, the problem is addressed by using a self-adapting machine learning system which uses information from the channel state to predict the transmit power level that is needed to overcome the interferences. This approach predicts the correct transmit power level when a package needs to be sent and thereby avoids wasting power on selecting a wrong transmit power level, i.e., either excess power is wasted or extra power is wasted to retransmit the packet. Extensive simulations based on data from smart homes show that this approach achieves power savings in the range of 42%-82% and a packet receive a ratio of at least 92%. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","interferences; IoT; linear regression; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Learning systems; Linear regression; Mathematical models; Sensors; Signal to noise ratio; Solar cells; Wave interference; Adaptive interference suppression; Channel state; Extensive simulations; interferences; Limited spectrum; Packet receive; Power savings; Transmit power; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Gartner, , https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/hardware-software-energy-environment-winningin-iot-all-about-winning-processes/, Oct; Loy, M., Karingattil, R., Williams, L., (2005) ISM-band and Short Range Device Regulatory Compliance Overview, , Texas Instrum., Dallas, TX, USA, Tech.

Customers are relying on the functionality and accuracy that is provided by the software. The last decades of software development, focused on sequential and phased models like the Waterfall model, Spiral model, etc, today the focus is on iterative and incremental methods in form of Agile methods. World's CMM level 5 companies are also using Agile methods to give a new edge to the software development. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to illustrate a two way assessment technique that can be adopted to infuse a continuous improvement in the software testing lifecycle. The two way assessment takes into consideration two things: The perspective of Management/ Developers is to highlight the importance of various testing attributes andworking on each of the attribute. Thus the ""Two-Fold Approach"" discussed in this paper is an attempt to go beyond the traditional methodology of measuring system effectiveness. It clearly emerges that agile methodology encourages better planning due to customer involvement and accommodates the desired changes easily. © 2018 IEEE.","Agile; Agile Methodologies; Two Fold Approach; Two-Way Assessment","Artificial intelligence; Coordinate measuring machines; Iterative methods; Software reliability; Software testing; Agile; Agile Methodologies; Assessment technique; Continuous improvements; Incremental method; Measuring systems; Two Fold Approach; Two ways; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cunningham, W., Agile Manifesto, , http://www.agilemanifesto.org/, Accessed on 17/11/2015; Merriam-Webster: Dictionary and Thesaurus, , http://www.merriamwebster.com, Accessed on 22/11/2015; Rashmi Poplil, A., Shchauhan, N., Mapping of Traditional Software Development Methods to Agile Methodologys; Kumar, G., Bhatia, P.K., Impact of agile methodology on software development process International Journal of Computer Technology and Electronics, , ISSN 2249-6343; Elghondakly, R., Moussa, S., Badr, N., Waterfall and agile requirements-based model 2015 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS'15); Hashmi, S., Baik, J., Software quality assurance in XP and spiral - A comparative study Fifth International Conference on Computational Science and Applications; Malhotra, R., Chug, A., Comparative analysis of agile methods and iterative enhancement model in assessment of software maintenance 2016 International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom); Olsen, D.H., Hauser, K., (2010) An Exploratory Study on Issues and Challenges of Agile Software Development with SCRUM, , A dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment the requirements for the degree of DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY; Aitken, A., Lingo, V., Comparative analysis of traditional software engineering and agile software development (2013) 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Arshadi, S., Muhammadi, S., Shahzad, S., Empirical analysis of traditional and agile requirement process (2013) Science and Tech. and Dev., 32 (1), pp. 44-47; Kapur, P.K., Measuring software testing efficiency using two-way assessment technique Reliability ICRITO(Trends and Future Directions), 2014, 3rd International Conference; Schwaber, K., Sutherland, J., (2012) Software in 30 Days: How Agile Managers Beat the Odds, Delight Their Customers, and Leave Competitors in the Dust, , Wiley; Rubin, K.S., (2012) Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process, , Addison Wesley Signature Series; Goldstein, I., (2013) Scrum Shortcuts Without Cutting Corners: Agile Tactics, Tools, & Tips, , Addison-Wesley Professional; Olsen, D.H., Hauser, K., (2010) An Exploratory Study on Issues and Challenges of Agile Software Development with SCRUM, , A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirments for the degree of DOCTOR OF PHILOSPHY; Paulish, D.J., Carleton, A.D., (1994) Case Studies of Software Process Improvement Measurement, , IEEE; Dustin, E., Rashka, J., Paul, J., Automated Software Testing Addison Wesley; Kapur, P.K., Nagpal, S., Khatri, S.K., Critical success factor utility based tool for ERP health assessment-A general framework (2014) IJSA; Kapur, P.K., Sachdeva, N., Khurana, D., Singh, G., (2012) Utility Based Tool to Assess Overall Effectiveness of Key HRD Instruments in An Organization, , International Business Horizon, INBUSH; Tian, J., Software Quality Engineering- Testing, Quality Assurance and Quantifiable Improvement, , IEEE Computer Society",,,"AICTE","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on ""Computational Intelligence and Communication Technology"", CICT 2018","9 February 2018 through 10 February 2018",,140372,,9781538608869,,,"English","Int.

This process aims to be applied to the construction and maintenance phases within Agile methodologies and Continuous Integration processes, where the quick and continuous test and changes at design or coding level can generate an increase or reduction of technical debt and green software levels. This process is based on phases, activities, techniques, and strategies proposed by related works about reverse engineering and software architecture reconstruction. Specifically, it integrates all of them to create a complete process; which may be a reference process by providing green and technical debt-oriented recommendations during the decision-making of software architecture at design level or coding level. This recommendation phase will be based on algorithms and techniques of Machine Learning, that will allow to apply the process in an Agile way and taking into account previous knowledge. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Green software; Machine learning; Reverse engineering; Software architecture; Software metrics; Software reconstruction; Technical debt","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Learning systems; Reverse engineering; Software testing; Agile Methodologies; Architecture reconstruction; Continuous integrations; Design levels; Green softwares; Software metrics; Software reconstruction; Technical debts; Software architecture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tom, E., Aurum, A., Vidgen, R., An exploration of technical debt (2013) J.

This paper describes an origami active learning exercise to teach the principles of Scrum in management information systems courses. The exercise shows students how Agile methods respond to changes in requirements during project implementation, one of the four Agile principles, in a deeper manner than many Agile active learning exercises. This learning activity uses an uncommon approach in Agile exercises in that tasks are provided, estimates made, progress is measured, and pivots to new tasks can be introduced based on task progress. All students were introduced to Scrum through two different lessons - one lecture-focused and one activity-focused. Students were surveyed after each lesson to determine lesson effectiveness. Students indicated they understood Agile concepts after completing the exercise and found the activity engaging. Students' perceptions of Agile were similar for both lecture and activity lessons. The results from the study find that students' perception of Agile learning increased when they had the lecture followed by the activity. If class time is constrained to a single lesson then the activity would be more beneficial than the lecture. Detailed instructions are provided for instructors to complete this activity. © 2018 by the Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals, Inc.

However, with the advent of agile methodologies in organizations of software development (the case of many information systems and technologies (IST)) no longer value the traditional PMO. It needs to be changed according to the agile values, so the organizations can extract benefits from such structure. These need to be fundamental changes in the responsibilities, practices and roles that a PMO should have. Also, it seems appropriate to rename it to something more descriptive and we chose to name it Agile Coordination Office (ACO). This paper presents the initial proposal of the ACO based on the existing literature. We propose the ACO to assume a behavior mainly supportive, due to the empowerment that every agile development team must have by definition. In addition, the architecture of this ACO aims to cover the various levels of management, from project and program up to the portfolio management. This division also reduces the complexity of ACO's implementation process and gives flexibility to rearrange the ACO over time. © 2018 The Authors.

Thus, the upgraded version of the V-model testing is supposed to deal with the weaknesses of the original version in question by combining it with the method known as agile testing. At the beginning of the report, hypothesis such as the strengths and weaknesses of the existing V-model testing via literature review and interviews with respective specialists in the sphere were analysed. Successively, the possible advantages of agile method of testing were then considered. Moreover, the report comes up with the ways in which the two models could be naturally combined to produce a much more effective one. Once the new model was presented, its strengths and weaknesses were assessed by the means of a case study analysis using metric and a data analysis through a survey were conducted to evaluate the credibility of the futurist model. Promptly, the research found that the suggested testing model provides better results than the common version of V-model testing. Firstly, a real case scenarios under metric evaluation of the models have indicated that the proposed model is better than the V-model, since it can handle the following aspects; reduced testing time, debugging, prioritization of requirements, easy mapping of roles and improved visibility of project resources. Secondly, a survey data analysis highlighted various advantages of the future model. The top priorities of the new model from the respondent's perception were; the new model manages rapidly changing priorities, it accelerates time to market, it increases productivity and it improves quality. © 2018 The Authors.

The aim of the paper consists of investigating how to combine the two technologies in order to obtain a new software development model: the affective agile design. The innovative software development model, indeed, leverages agile - Scrum Framework guidelines and recalls affective design practices that consist of collecting and analyzing emotional feedback during the running process. The proposed model, furthermore, address firmly people-oriented principles, that have opened up a new front in regards of the needs of the productive path, calling in a loud voice the initiation of affective design practices. The main pillars of the proposed agile affective design model are the following: defining the points of the process where iteration with individuals is strong, intercepting their emotional expressions, analyzing their useful contributions and proceeding with systematic affective analysis leading to an optimized process of change management. In order to measure the validity of the proposed model, a real instance of a software developed by using the basic agile methodology at Fastweb Spa has been studied. The results have demonstrated that the benefits obtained by the use of the proposed innovative software development model overcome the main pain-points identified in the use case. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Affective computing; Affective design; Agile methodology; Artificial intelligence; Scrum; Software development models",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Scrum - Guida Pratica Definitiva Alle Pratiche Della Metodologia Di Sviluppo Agile!, , Babelcube Inc; Mironov, R., (2012) The Agile Product Manager - Product Owner Dilemma, , Mironov Consulting; Beck, K., (2004) Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, , Boston, Addison-Wesley; Lin, J., (2015) Human Factors in Agile Software Development; Waters, K., (2012) All about Agile, , Paperback; Rosalind, W., (1999) PICARD, Affective Computing, , The Mit Press; Minsky, M., (1985) La società Della Mente, , Adelphi; Dongrui, W.U., Optimal Arousal Identification and Classification for Affective Computing Using Physiological Signals: Virtual Reality Stroop Task (2010) IEEE Computer Society; Reynolds, C., Picard, R.W., Designing for Affective Interactions, , MIT Media Laboratory; Jiao, J., Zhang, Y., Helander, M., A Kansei Mining System for Affective Design, , Elsevier; Poria, S., Cambria, E., Bajpaj, R., Hussain, A., A Review of Affective Computing: From Unimodal Analysis to Multimodal Fusion, , Elsevier; Pieroni, M., Rizzello, L., Rosini, N., Mazzei, D., Affective Internet of Things: Mimicking humanlike personality in designing smartobjects Conference Paper; Pazienza, M.T., Scarpato, N., Stellato, A., Turbati, A., Din din!

The purpose of this study is to provide a better understanding of practices and challenges when developing academic software engineering MOOCs. To this end, we research (i) how MOOCs in SEE are designed and (ii) what learning design considerations educators and learning designers have when developing SEE-related MOOCs. To address the first research question, a systematic mapping is performed to outline the current landscape. The second research question is answered by analyzing and reflecting on practical experiences acquired during the design of a MOOC on Agile Software Development. The design of the course was based on the Pedagogical Design Pattern Framework for MOOCs, an approach to design for learning that was defined in our previous studies. For this course, two environments were considered: (a) course-time on the Tim Tec MOOC platform for deeper engagement with active learning activities, such as Project-based learning; (b) a Facebook group as a social and collaborative learning space, including scenarios based on problem-based learning to activate prior knowledge. Some of the pedagogical strategies adopted to motivate self-regulated learning included self-introduction video, diary, diagnostic self-assessments, development of small projects alone and in pairs. Our findings provide evidence that there are still several technological and pedagogical challenges that need to be addressed so as to enhance the MOOCs learning experience for SEE. Technological issues identified include the development of tools and educational games, which should be integrated into MOOCs, and the use of learning analytics to support motivation, user experience, and more active learning in specific topics, such as Project Management, Agile Methods, and Requirements Engineering. In turn, the most significant and needed improvement to the pedagogical aspects is a re-thinking of the virtual moment in the MOOC platform so as to optimize it through activities that promote active learning and contextualized assessments. © 2017 IEEE.","Agile software development; Design patterns; Learning design; Lifelong learning; MOOCs; Software engineering education","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; E-learning; Project management; Software design; Software engineering; Teaching; Agile software development; Design Patterns; Learning designs; Life long learning; MOOCs; Engineering education",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors are grateful to the Brazilian funding agencies (CNPq, Capes, Fapemig, Fapesp) and the IFSULDEMINAS for their financial support.

Hence, it is desirable that the software development industries should have proper planning for estimating the effort required in agile software development. The existing techniques such as expert opinion, analogy and disaggregation are mostly observed to be ad hoc and in this manner inclined to be mistaken in a number of cases. One of the various approaches for calculating effort of agile projects in an empirical way is the story point approach (SPA). This paper presents a study on analysis of prediction accuracy of estimation process executed in order to improve it using SPA. Different machine learning techniques such as decision tree, stochastic gradient boosting and random forest are considered in order to assess prediction more qualitatively. A comparative analysis of these techniques with existing techniques is also presented and analyzed in order to critically examine their performance. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.","Agile software development; Decision tree; Random forest; Software effort estimation; Stochastic gradient boosting; Story point approach","Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Object oriented programming; Software engineering; Stochastic systems; Agile software development; Point approach; Random forests; Software effort estimation; Stochastic gradient boosting; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrahamsson, P., Fronza, I., Moser, R., Vlasenko, J., Pedrycz, W., Predicting development effort from user stories (2011) Empirical software engineering and measurement (ESEM), 2011 international symposium on, IEEE, pp. 400-403; Azzeh, M., Nassif, A.B., Minku, L.L., An empirical evaluation of ensemble adjustment methods for analogy-based effort estimation (2015) J Syst Softw, 103, pp. 36-52; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Mach Learn, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Britto, R., Mendes, E., Borstler, J., An empirical investigation on effort estimation in agile global software development (2015) Global Software Engineering (ICGSE), 2015 IEEE 10th International Conference on.

This is due to the nature of first year students characterized by under-preparedness, poor academic background and so on. Moreover, the traditional lecture-based approach is used and the computer laboratories are rarely used. Consequently, students are not motivated, engaged or no active participation. While this teaching approach has failed to achieve learning outcome, incorporating cutting-edge practices like agile methods into the teaching could be valuable. This stems from the widespread in practice and acceptance of agile methods in the software industries today. Though agile practices like pair programming have impacted students' programming projects, none has been reported on teaching. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach of teaching CP using the agile methods. The goal is to assist beginners acquire needed programming skills, proffer teaching technique that maximizes the chances of engagement, active participation, and improving teaching by reflecting on what has been taught and what the students are learning. Additionally, beginners will be able to operate the computer, write correct code, gain better programming skills and assist teachers to manage large classes effectively. To achieve this, the study adopted the framework for decoding the discipline. © 2015 IEEE.","Agile process; Computer programming; Learning; Teaching; Undergraduate students","Artificial intelligence; Education; Education computing; Students; Teaching; Agile process; Computer laboratory; Computer Science Education; Learning; Programming projects; Teaching and learning; Teaching techniques; Undergraduate students; Computer programming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Northedge, A., (2003) Rethinking Teaching in the Context of Diversity Teaching in Higher Education, 8 (1); Biggs, J., What the Student Does: Teaching for enhanced learning (1999) Higher Education Research & Development, 18 (1), pp. 57-75; Jones, G., Knezek, G., Non-commercial radio-satellite telecommunications: Affordable options for technology educators.

In this paper we propose an innovative methodology for project management. This is done by emphasizing quality management, software development, skills, team values, etc. Our vision began by analyzing these keys concepts. Then studying the used methodologies. Proposing precise process and skills are our priority. The uncertain situation are also taking into account in our approach. Our vision is to refine the methodology used for the management, find an answer for uncertain situations, to make the right decision for each stage of life cycle of the project. All these all points are the keys of our methodology. This brings us back to the spirit of Decision Support System, which is one of the pillars of this methodology.

Teaching and learning at university has since migrated from traditional learning to active learning methodology where students are expected to learn by doing rather than listening passively to lectures alone. The agile methodology naturally has promoted the active participation of team members during system development phases. Some literature have proposed ways of adopting agile into active learning to improve teaching and learning processes and have highlighted this method as a great success. We would like to highlight how efficient the agile concept is in tackling several situations in academic learning as shown by an interesting mapping of agile principles to the classroom environment. We also offer options for the agile evaluation framework to consider academic environment as a tool to obtain the agile performance feedback. © 2016 by IGI Global.

This phrase, which symbolically connotes a whole scheme of a signs system, is known as Semiotics. This paper presents the process of an educational video game development based on semiotic analysis. We used Extreme Programing Agile Methodology combined with a proposal of the modified Elemental Tetrad Game Design Model to develop a video game known as ""Tic-Tac-Toe"". The mathematical model was implemented with Artificial Intelligence algorithms and a graphical user interface including Semiotics; this was optimized for producing an enjoyable and interactive environment. With the purpose of stimulating cognitive development of children, this research combines theories about stimulating cognitive development of children; game design model, Semiotic Analysis harnesses the Model of Aleferenko, and uses algorithms based on heuristics and numerical methods in client-server architecture. The concept was tested with a representative sample of seven to eleven years old children. The results demonstrated that educational video games with Semiotics stimulate the cognitive development of children. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

In this paper, we present a grammar for stories of interaction called UserX Story, in order to remedy the difficulties encountered by teams to insert UX aspects and usability requirements in the first steps of software conception. An action research approach was applied to carry out the research within the industry, allowing us to work closely with the agile teams. The research cycle was split in three steps. In the first step, we carried out a technical literature survey, aiming to investigate the use of user stories in the agile methodologies, and additionally, an ethnographic study also was carried out in order to understand how the traditional user stories were being developed by product owners. In the second step, we proposed together with both teams - UX and agile - a grammar to UserX Story incorporating two concepts of UX: personas and Nielsen’s heuristics. In the third step, six product owners were invited to implement the UserX Stories in real projects. After that, we interviewed the participants aiming to collect their experiences with the implementation of UserX Stories. Thus, we have found out that most of the agile teams approved the use of the stories incorporating UX aspects. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Agile; Scrum; Usability; User experience; User story","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Agile; Scrum; Usability; User experience; User stories; Human computer interaction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barksdale, J., Ragan, E., McCrickard, D., (2009) Easing Team Usability: A Concept Mapping Approach, , Agile Conference.

Between the techniques being applied by instructors to counteract this fact, we can find gamification techniques. Unfortunately, sometimes the result is the appearance of unwanted effects, which is a very common symptom of poor designs caused by the lack of proven methodologies for its purpose. This paper presents our first approach of a conceptual framework for designing the gamification of learning experiences. It is focused in higher education and based on the use of the Agile methodologies in order to obtain a fast Minimum Viable Product (MVP) ready for testing. Its aims are to apply different techniques all the way down to the lowest levels of abstraction through its step-by-step process. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Design; Framework; Gamification; Higher education; Learning","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Design; Agile Methodologies; Conceptual frameworks; Framework; Gamification; Higher education; Learning; Learning experiences; Levels of abstraction; Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barata, G., Gama, S., Jorge, J., Gonçalves, D., So fun it hurts–gamifying an engineering course (2013) AC 2013.

In the early software developing methodologies, customer requirements are ambiguous because of which specifications can be solidified. This is due to the unbending structure of old and traditional methodologies. Over the last decade, more than a few innovative software development methodologies have been developed particularly to resolve problems in the region of software quality. Such group of methodologies is called “agile.” These methodologies mostly focus on how to maximize flexibility and minimize transparency in the process of software development. These methodologies are not only based on theory, but also rather derived from experiences of successful project teams. Based on the current trend in the software industry, software developing companies are choosing agile methodologies in which scrum is widely used. In this work, the adoption process of scrum by a software company is discussed. © Springer India 2016.","Adoption; Agile; Enterprise culture; Scrum","Agile manufacturing systems; Artificial intelligence; Computer software selection and evaluation; Software engineering; Adoption; Agile; Agile Methodologies; Customer requirements; Enterprise culture; Scrum; Software development methodologies; Software industry; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reddaiah, B., Ravi, S.P., Movva, L.S., Risk management board for effective risk management in scrum (2013) Int J Comput Appl, 65, pp. 16-23; Ravi, S.P., Reddaiah, B., Movva, L.S., Kilaparthi, R., A Critical review and empirical study on success of risk management activity with respect to scrum (2012) Eng Sci Technol: Int J, 2, pp. 467-473; Schwaber, K., (2004) Agile Project Management with Scrum, , Redmond: Microsoft Press; Schwaber, K., Beedle, M., (2002) Agile Software Development with Scrum, , Prentice Hall; Poppendieck, M., A history of lean: Form manufacturing to software development (2005) JAOO Conference, , Aathus, Denmarh; Liker, J.K., (2004) The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles from the world’s Greatest Manufacturer, , New York: McGraw-hill; Holford, W.D., Ebrahimi, M., Honda: Approach to innovation in aerospace and automotive/pick-up truck development: A dialectical yet coherent firm (2007) 40Th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-40) Big Island Hawaii; Tekeuchi, H., Nonaka, I., (2004) Hitotsubashi on Knowledge Managemennt, , Singapore: Wiley; Senge, P.M., (1990) The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of The Learning Organization, , Currency New York","Reddaiah, B.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: b.reddaiah@yogivemanauniversity.ac.in","Panigrahi B.K.Bhaskar M.A.Das S.Dash S.S.","","Springer Verlag","International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Evolutionary Computations in Engineering Systems, ICAIECES 2015","22 April 2015 through 23 April 2015",,164469,21945357,9788132226543,,,"English","Adv.

The well-known Agile methodology advances projects in a chain of rapid development cycles, with subsequent steps often informed by production experiments. Support for such workflow in machine learning applications remains primitive. The platform developed at if(we) embodies a specific machine learning approach and a rigorous data architecture constraint, so allowing teams to work in rapid iterative cycles. We require models to consume data from a time-ordered event history, and we focus on facilitating creative feature engineering. We make it practical for data scientists to use the same model code in development and in production deployment, and make it practical for them to collaborate on complex models. We deliver real-time recommendations at scale, returning top results from among 10,000,000 candidates with sub-second response times and incorporating new updates in just a few seconds. Using the approach and architecture described here, our team can routinely go from ideas for new models to production-validated results within two weeks.","Agile; Machine learning; Recommender systems","Agile manufacturing systems; Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Iterative methods; Recommender systems; Agile; Agile Methodologies; Feature engineerings; Machine learning applications; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Real-time application; Software disciplines; Learning systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data Mining Hackathon on (20 Mb) Best Buy Mobile Web Site - ACM SF Bay Area Chapter, , http://bit.ly/1O3eDOD, Accessed: 2015-02-20; Stream Processing Explained, , http://www.sqlstream.com/stream-processing/, Accessed: 2015-02-20; Akidau, T., Balikov, A., Bekiroʇlu, K., Chernyak, S., Haberman, J., Lax, R., McVeety, S., Whittle, S., Millwheel: Fault-tolerant stream processing at internet scale (2013) Proc.

Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) is highly uncertain and raises the need for agile methods that assess the channel conditions and apply actions maximizing communication success. In this paper, we present TIIM, a lightweight Technology-Independent Interference Mitigation solution that detects, quantifies, and reacts to CTI in realtime. TIIM employs a lightweight machine learning classifier to (i) decide whether communication is viable over the interfered link, (ii) characterize the ambient conditions and apply the best coexistence mitigation strategy. We present an in-depth experimental characterization of the effect of CTI on 802.15.4 links, which motivated and influenced the design of TIIM. Our evaluation shows that TIIM, while exposed to extensive and heterogeneous interference, can achieve a total PRR improvement of 30% with an additional transmission overhead of 5.6%.

A limited number of research works have been published in this area. The existing process tailoring approaches describe similar set of operations and do not provide proper guidelines on performing process tailoring. These tailoring approaches mainly focus on large companies and tailor only one or two agile methods instead of providing specific guidelines on tailoring agile based methodologies. Unlike large companies, attention has not been given to small and medium sized companies. The present study addresses this limitation, identifies process tailoring operations, key processes of agile based methodologies and uses them for tailoring processes for small and medium sized companies. Qualitative research methods are used to identify and validate tailoring operations and key processes of agile based methodologies. The results show that performing these tailoring operations to tailor key agile based processes is an effective and applicable process tailoring approach for small and medium sized companies. The outcome of the present study would provide basis for formulating process tailoring framework for small and medium sized companies. © 2014 IEEE.","Agile; Client; Process tailoring; Processes","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Processing; Software engineering; Agile; Agile methods; Client; Large companies; Process tailoring; Qualitative research methods; Small and medium-sized companies; Software development process; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yoon, I.-C., Tailoring and verifying software process (2001) Proceedings of the 8th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference, pp. 202-209; Dai, F., Li, T., Tailoring software evolution process (2007) 8th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artifical Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributing Computing, pp. 782-787; Xu, P., Ramesh, B., Using process tailoring to manage software development challenges (2008) IEEE Computer Society ITPro; Nerur, S., Challenges of migrating to agile methodologies (2005) Communications of the ACM, 48, pp. 73-78; (2001) Software Engineering Institue, , http//www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/, CMMI Development Team, Capability Maturity Model-Integrated Version 1. 1; (2000) International Organization for Standardization, ISO Standard 9001: Quality Management Systems; Harry, M.J., Schroeder, R., (2006) Six Sigma: The Breakthrough Management Strategy Revolutionizing the World's Top Corporations, , Crown Publishing Group; Poppendieck, M., Poppendieck, T., (2003) Lean Software Development An Agile Toolkit, , Addison-Wesley; Highsmith, J., Cockburn, A., Agile software development: The business of innovation (2001) IEEE Computer, 34, pp. 120-127; Boehm, B., Get ready for agile methods, with care (2002) Computer, 35, pp. 64-69; (2001) Principles behind the Agile Manifesto Agile Alliance, , http//agilemanifesto.org/principles.html; Ferreira, C., Cohen, J., Agile systems development and stakeholder satisfaction: A south african empirical study (2008) Proceedings of SAICSIT'08, pp. 48-55; Pedreira, O., A systematic review of software process tailoring (2007) ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 32; Hossain, E., Towards an understanding of tailoring scrum in global software development: A multi-case study (2011) 2011 International Conference on Software and System Process, pp. 110-119; Welzel, D., Tailoring and conformance testing of software processes: The procept approach (1995) The Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE Software Engineering Standards Symposium; Xu, P., Ramesh, B., A tool for the capture and use of process knowledge in process tailoring (2003) Proceedings of the 36th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'03); Seaman, C.B., Qualitative methods in empirical studies of software engineering (1999) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 25, pp. 557-572. , July/August; Runeson, P., Host, M., Guideline for conducting and reporting case study research in software engineering (2009) Empirical Software Engineering, 14, pp. 131-164; Mirakhorli, M., RDP Technique: A Practice to Customize XP (2008) APSO'08, , Leipzig, Germany; Gopal, A., The role of software processes and communication in offshore software development (2002) Communications of the ACM, 45, pp. 193-199; Nasir, M.H.N., Sahibuddin, S., Critical Success Factors for Software Projects: A Comaprative Study (2011) Scientific Research and Essays, 6, pp. 2174-2186. , 18 May; Reel, J.S., Critical success factors in software projects (1999) IEEE Software, 16, pp. 18-23; Ramasubbu, N., Balan, R.K., Towards governance schemes for distributed software development projects (2008) SDG'08, , May 12,Leipzig, Germany,2008; Aiken, J., Technical and human perspective on pair programming (2004) ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 29 (5); Turk, D., Limitations of agile software processes (2002) Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on EXtreme Programming and Agile Processes in Software Engineering, , ACM, USA; Flick, U., (2009) An Introduction to Qualitative Research, , Sage Publications Ltd.

This paper shows how Method for Elicitation, Documentation and Validation of Software User Requirements (MEDoV) supports agile and lean software development methodologies. The MEDoV helps stakeholders in their everyday work with minimal impact on agility. The method also ensures an active role of business users, a wide-picture what usually is the problem for agile development, and definition of non-functional requirements, what the even bigger problem is. The MEDoV ensures that no unnecessary features are produced so that no extra code is created, and maintenance is easier, as well as code correction and improvement. Using models enables agility in product maintenance, especially for integrated systems where one change can have multiple impacts on different parts of system. © 2014 IEEE.","Agile Methodologies; Business Process Management; Event-driven Process Chain (EPC) Method; Lean Software Development; Requirements Engineering; UML Diagrams","Administrative data processing; Agile manufacturing systems; Artificial intelligence; Enterprise resource management; Maintenance; Requirements engineering; Software engineering; Agile Methodologies; Business process management; Event driven process chain; Lean software development; UML diagrams; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boehm, B., Get ready for agile methods, with care (2002) IEEE Computer, 35 (1), pp. 64-69; Poppendieck, M., Poppendieck, T., (2003) Lean Software Development, , Addison-Wesley; Rodríguez, P., Markkula, J., Oivo, M., Garbajosa, J., Analyzing the drivers of the combination of lean and agile in software development companies (2012) PROFES 2012, LNCS, 7343, pp. 145-159; Sillitti, A., Succi, G., (2005) Requirements Engineering for Agile Methods Engineering and Managing Software Requirements, pp. 309-326. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Helmy, W., Kamel, A., Hegazy, O., Requirements engineering methodology in agile environment (2012) IJCSI '12, 9 (5), pp. 293-300. , No 3, September; Hammer, M., (1996) Beyond Reengineering: How the Processed-centered Organization is Changing Our Work and Our Lives, , Harper Business, New York; Kohlbacher, M., The effects of process orientation on customer satisfaction, product quality and time-based performance (2009) 29th Intern.

Data processing was, is and will be at the center of interest of all firms, organizations and individuals. The reasons are natural. There is an enormous amount of information, and orientation is very difficult with regards to data volume, variety and velocity. The selection of the correct way for optimal computational processing has a number of forms via preferences by actual conditions and IT user preferences. The better solutions are designed with support in cooperation with the global environment. The new approaches and ideas are often linked to innovations based on inspiration from swarm intelligence, trust in an agile method, or graphic support within the simulation. All such approaches help in software development and optimal implementation through settings and configuration, but many IT users have doubts about their real benefits in practice. They have problems with complexity, orientation, offered services, or timelines of obtained results and analyses. Based on this reality, there is a question about a better method for simulation design for optimal software development with regards to actual reality. These simulations are successfully used in software specification through needed objects. Standard objects are used for the description of the adopted resolution based on object features such as Name, Size, and Capacity. For actual reality description, there are other features needed with links on current context. Inspiration of this idea is based on pheromones from swarm intelligence like a point of interaction. These additional object features are oriented on practical preferences such as standard professional matter, cooperation, presentation, management, analytical matter, creativity, multicultural needs, services, and contact with the customer. Practical preferences then define the total priority of an object in a simulation. The benefit of the total priority of an object is a better relation to actual reality, and an optimal description of existing needs by preferences in a dynamic society. This approach offers a better way of software development like operating and database systems, or BI (Business Intelligence) and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) products.","Global changes; Object features; Software development; Swarm intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Data handling; Database systems; Management science; Public relations; Software engineering; Amount of information; Computational processing; Customer relationship management; Global change; Interaction features; Object features; Software Specification; Swarm Intelligence; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Annan, K., (2000) We the People, the Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century, , United Nations; Abramsky, S., Petri Nets, Discrete Physics, and Distributed Quantum Computation [Online], , http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/files/381/fest.pdf, Oxford University Computing Laboratory, [cit. 2012-12-14]; Berger, M., Soler, J., Brewka, L., Yu, H., Tsagkaropoulos, M., Leclerc, Y., Olma, C., Methodology and toolset for model verification, hardware/software co- simulation, performance optimisation and customisable source-code generation (2013) WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications, 10, pp. 169-178; Globalization and Civil Society, Bělohoubek, I., (2006) Globalization and Global Issues, , UK in Prague, Center for the Environment; Blum, C.H., Merkle, D., (2008) Swarm Intelligence: Introduction and Applications (Natural Computing Series), , Springer; Buzan, T., (2007) Mental Mapping, , Prague Portal; Cagnazzo, L., Tiacci, L., Rossi, V., Knowledge management system in SMEs within stable enterprise networks (2014) WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics, 11, pp. 155-174; Catania, V., Patti, D., Palesi, M., Spadaccini, A., Fazzino, F., An open and platfom-independent instruction-set simulator for teaching computer architecture (2014) WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications, 11, pp. 42-50; Claunch, C., (2012) Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2013, , Gartner; (2011) Communication for Development, , United Nations Development Programme in USA, and Oslo Governance Centre in Norway; (2013) Company Presentation, , Infineon Technologies AG; Consumer Innovation Program [Online], , http://imagineh2o.org/prizes/enter-2012.php, [cit. 2012-12-04]; Corona, E., Pani, F.E., A review of lean- kanban approaches in the software development (2013) WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications, 10, pp. 1-13; Definition of Information, Data - Information - Knowledge [Online], , http://web.sks.cz/users/ku/ZIZ/inform1.htm, [cit. 2013-01-15]; Difference between Data and Information [Online], , http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-data-and-information/, [cit. 2012-11-20]; Exploring Social Innovations [online], , http://www.innov8social.com/, [cit. 2013-04-05]; Future Needs Knowledge and Skills in Europe Outlook 2020 [Online], , http://www.euroguidance.cz/cz/publikaceeuroguidance/budouci-potreby-znalosti-adovednosti-v-evrope-vyhled-do-roku-2020.html, CEDEFOP European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training.

The objective of our study is to identify factors that affect the expansion of agile software development in large organizations. We performed a multiple-case study to do so. We found agile software development in large organizations is more than implementing Scrum. In particular, we identified ”agile mindset” as a crucial topic that deserves attention when expanding agile methods in large organizations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Agile expansion;

This often results in team members over emphasizing their understanding of the goals, without proper incorporation of goals from other stakeholders or customers. Existing UML or other goal oriented modeling methods tend to be overly complex for non-technical stakeholders to properly express their goals and communicate them to the agile team. In this paper, we propose a light weight Goal Net based method to model goal requirements in agile software development process to address this problem. It can be used to decompose complex processes into phased goals, and model low level user stories to high level hierarchy goal structures. Our preliminary analysis and studies in educational software engineering contexts show that it can improve agile team's group awareness to project goals and, thus, improve team productivity and artifact quality. The proposed approach was evaluated in university level agile software engineering projects. It has achieved an improvement of over 50 percentage points in terms of the proportion of high quality user stories generated by students compared to the standard user story template used in Scrum, © 2014 IEEE.","Agile Software Development; Goal Net; Software Engineering","Artificial intelligence; Quality control; Software design; Agile software development; Agile software development process; Agile software engineering; Goal Net; Goal oriented modeling; Preliminary analysis; Software requirements; Technical stakeholders; Software engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vlaanderena, K., Jansena, S., Brinkkempera, S., The agile requirements refinery: Applying SCRUM principles to software product management (2011) Information and Software Technology, 53 (1), pp. 58-70. , January; Boehm, B., Get ready for agile methods, with care (2002) Computer, 35 (1), pp. 64-+. , Jan; Aoyama, M., Agile software process and its experience (1998) Proceedings of the 1998 International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 3-12; Lee, J., Xue, N.-L., Analyzing user requirements by use cases: A goal-driven approach (1999) IEEE Software, 16 (4), pp. 92-101; Leea, J., Xuea, N.-L., Kuob, J.-Y., Structuring requirement specifications with goals (2001) Information and Software Technology, 43 (2), pp. 121-135; Kobryn, C., Will UML 2. 0 be agile or awkward?

They are based on agile principles that sharply contrast to traditional command-and-control management methods. Such methods emphasize the importance of highly interactive self-organizing teams and close collaboration of all stakeholders, as well as values like courage, openness and respect. However, recent studies show that graduates and undergraduates of computer science often lack the collaborative and communicative skills necessary for agile methods and, thus, are not yet well enough educated for agile development approaches. Therefore, new approaches or more adequate educational methods for teaching the necessary communication and collaboration skills need to be developed. In a recent interview study, the authors elicited specific collaboration and communication skills needed in agile teams. In this paper, we present results from this study and discuss teaching concepts for collaboration skills from both engineering and psychological points of view. We suggest an approach on how to integrate these concepts into university courses, that focuses on active learning of agile collaboration.

This is based on a combination of linear programming method, for assignment of tasks, and the task management method, Scrum. This proposal aids in management and optimization of the time of completion of the project or sprint without removing the inherent flexibility of agile methodologies. A support tool was developed to assist in the applicability of DSS. It is concluded that the DSS proposed can assign tasks to minimize the total execution time of the sprint and it assists the managers in assessing developers, since it will be possible to determine whether they are meeting the deadlines within established goals for their level of seniority. © 2013 IEEE.","Component; Decision support system; Level of seniority; Project software management; Scrum metodology","Agile Methodologies; Component; Decision support system (dss); Hybrid methodologies; Inherent flexibility; Level of seniority; Scrum metodology; Software management; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Optimization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adolph, S., Kruchten, P., Hall, W., Reconciling perspectives: A grounded theory of how people manage the process of software development (2012) The Journal of Systems and Software, 85, pp. 1269-1286; Carneiro, L.S., Queiroz, M.A., Barros, R.M., Brancher, J.D., Iso 9001 implementation with scrum - A case study (2012) Trasnl.

This paper describes how Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) can be used as Computational Intelligence (CI) tools for Decision Support (DS) in reducing the risks of the implications in this adaptation or transformation process. Particularly, FCM are used in understanding the effect of a set of critical Agile Adoption Factors (AAF) proposed in literature in the success of adopting agile. A set of preliminary experiments have been conducted to show that AAF can be evaluated with the use of FCM and their effect on adoption success is validated in three specific contexts. The scenarios investigated show that a critical implication is corporate bureaucracy. Also, results indicate that some enablers are the project teams’ personal traits, such as collaborative attitude and readiness to change, as well as, the customers’ level of commitment. The proposed FCM model provides an insight on the usefulness of the method for assessing agile transformation success. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Agile; Computational intelligence; Decision support; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Software projects","Agile manufacturing systems; Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Enterprise software; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Agile; Agile transformations; Decision support tools; Decision supports; Enterprise agility; Fuzzy cognitive map; Software project; Transformation process; Decision support systems",,,,,"246016; European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics; Seventh Framework Programme","Acknowledgements.

As the emphasis of user experience work has inherently been on the early phases before starting the development, it also needs to be adapted to the Agile way of working. To improve the current practices in Agile user experience work, we determined the present state of a multi-continental software development organization that already had a functioning user experience team. In this paper, we describe the most prevalent issues regarding the interaction of user experience design and software development activities, and suggest improvements to fix those. Most of the observed problems were related to communication issues and to the service mode of the user experience team.

Such methods pose considerable challenges related to organizational demand and process configuration. Goal: In this paper, we analyze the introduction of Scrum in the development organization in order to determine distinct approaches to its implementation. Approach: We compare the Scrum introduction paths of four case companies. Results: This results in a discussion of implementation paths ranging from gradual to disruptive introduction of Scrum. Contribution: The description of these paths provides insight into process improvements. We demonstrate how a structured description of process improvements can improve understanding of process improvement paths. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","incremental; process implementation; product software; Scrum; software process improvement","incremental; Process implementation; Product software; Scrum; Software Process Improvement; Artificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrahamsson, P., Warsta, J., Siponen, M.T., Ronkainen, J., New directions on agile methods: A comparative analysis (2003) Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 244-254. , IEEE; Beck, K., (1999) Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston; Beck, K., Beedle, M., Van Bennekum, A., Cockburn, A., Cunningham, W., Fowler, M., Grenning, J., Thomas, D., (2001), http://www.agilemanifesto.org; Boehm, B., Turner, R., (2004) Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide for the Perplexed, , Pearson Education, Boston; Boehm, B., Turner, R., Management Challenges to Implementing Agile Processes in Traditional Development Organizations (2005) IEEE Software, 22 (5), pp. 30-39; Borjesson, A., Mathiassen, L., Successful process implementation (2004) IEEE Software, 21 (4), pp. 36-44; Cohn, M., Ford, D., Introducing an Agile Process to an Organization (2003) Computer, 36 (6), pp. 74-78; Dingsoyr, T., Hanssen, G.K., Dyba, T., Anker, G., Nygaard, J.O., Developing software with scrum in a small cross-organizational project (2006) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 4257 LNCS, pp. 5-15. , Software Process Improvement - 13th European Conference, EuroSPI 2006, Proceedings; Dyba, T., Dingsøyr, T., Empirical studies of agile software development: A systematic review (2008) Information and Software Technology, 50 (9-10), pp. 833-859; Fitzgerald, B., Hartnett, G., Conboy, K., Customising agile methods to software practices at Intel Shannon (2006) European Journal of Information Systems, 15 (2), pp. 200-213; Jansen, S., Brinkkemper, S., Applied Multi-Case Research in a Mixed-Method Research Project: Customer Configuration Updating Improvement (2007) Information Systems Research Methods, Epistemology, and Applications, pp. 120-139. , Cater-Steel, A., Al-Hakimi, L.
