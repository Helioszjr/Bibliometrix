# Bibliometrix
Practice developed with the Bibliometrix package in the R Studio package

The course will demonstrate, in a practical way, how to perform searches and collect results in two of the main multidisciplinary bibliographic databases, Web of Science and Scopus. The collected data will then be unified, normalized and summarized using a script developed with the Bibliometrix package in the R Studio suite. Finally, the biblioshiny tool will be presented for visualizing data in the form of different types of bibliometric analyses.
