CONSIDERING THE EFFECT OF MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN 2020, TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME EVEN MORE INFLUENTIAL. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE VERY RAPID DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING, INTERNET OF THINGS, MACHINE LEARNING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND 5G AND CONSEQUENTLY THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS UPSKILLING OF EXPERT HUMAN RESOURCES HAVE MADE THE ADAPTATION OF TRADITIONAL LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS TO THIS NEW HUMAN CONDITION A VITAL ISSUE. WHILE THE AFOREMENTIONED PHENOMENON IS BEING EXPERIENCED, A TALENT GAP IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE COMPETENCIES OF THE GRADUATES OF COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING, SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND OTHER RELATED DEPARTMENTS AND INDUSTRY EXPECTATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION APPROACHES OF THE UNIVERSITIES. THE SHORTENING OF THE LIFESPAN OF THE PRODUCED VOCATIONAL KNOWLEDGE DAY BY DAY CONTINUES TO INCREASE THIS GAP. FOR THIS REASON, IT HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN APPROACH THAT IS MORE SUITABLE FOR THIS DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS STUDY, IT HAS BEEN EXAMINED WHETHER THE AGILE METHODS, WHICH HAVE BECOME WIDESPREAD WITHIN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IN THE LAST 15 YEARS, HAVE SIMILAR POTENTIAL WHEN USED AS A TRAINING METHOD. DURING THE STUDY, 49 STUDENTS FROM THE ENGINEERING FACULTY OF A TURKISH UNIVERSITY PARTICIPATED IN THE \"AGILE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\" COURSE. THE CURRICULUM DESIGN, LEARNING EXPERIENCES, STUDENT PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE OTHER RESULTS HAVE BEEN SHARED. IN THIS COURSE, 3 SPRINTS ARE DESIGNED WITH 8 AGILE PROJECT TEAMS THAT ARE SELF- ORGANIZED WITH THE SCRUM FRAMEWORK. CONTINUOUS TEAM LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES WERE EVALUATED AND THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN APPLYING \"AGILITY\" APPROACH TO STUDENTS WHILE DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND THE EFFECT OF AGILE METHOD ON THE PERFORMANCE OF LEARNING WERE EXAMINED.

WE APPLY A COMBINATION OF THE CHALLENGE BASED LEARNING (CBL) AND OF THE SCRUM FRAMEWORK FROM THE AGILE METHODOLOGY, TO BOOST THE STUDENTS' PARTICIPATION IN THIS INNOVATION PROCESS. IN THIS EMPIRICAL STUDY, STUDENTS WILL BE CHALLENGED TO PROPOSE A NEW IDEA FOR A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, DEVELOP A NEW CONCEPTUAL MODEL, AND EVALUATE THE MODEL USING A SERIES OF SURVEYS. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE METHODOLOGIES IMPLEMENTED WILL BE SHOWN, AS WELL AS THE BENEFITS AND DIFFICULTIES FELT BY THE STUDENTS IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION.";"CHALLENGE BASED LEARNING; AGILE METHODOLOGY; INNOVATION; ENGINEERING";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"CMUP - FCT (PORTUGAL) [UID/MAT/00144/2013]; MEC; EUROPEAN STRUCTURAL FUNDS (FEDER), UNDER THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT PT2020";"CMUP'S AUTHOR WAS PARTIALLY SUPPORTED BY CMUP (UID/MAT/00144/2013), WHICH IS FUNDED BY FCT (PORTUGAL) WITH NATIONAL (MEC) AND EUROPEAN STRUCTURAL FUNDS (FEDER), UNDER THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT PT2020.";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"A.

CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS OR CHATBOTS REFLECT A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO TARGET THOSE AFFECTED ONLINE BY PROVIDING PSYCHOEDUCATION AND COPING SKILLS, THUS FILLING THE GAP IN SERVICE PROVISION. OBJECTIVE: A WORLD-FIRST BODY IMAGE CHATBOT CALLED \"KIT\" WAS DESIGNED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS PRELIMINARY ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY VIA THE COLLECTION OF QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK FROM YOUNG PEOPLE AND PARENTS/CARERS REGARDING THE CONTENT, STRUCTURE, AND DESIGN OF THE CHATBOT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN AGILE METHODOLOGY STRATEGY. THE CHATBOT WAS DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH AUSTRALIA'S NATIONAL EATING DISORDER SUPPORT ORGANIZATION, THE BUTTERFLY FOUNDATION. METHODS: A CONVERSATION DECISION TREE WAS DESIGNED THAT OFFERED PSYCHOEDUCATIONAL INFORMATION ON BODY IMAGE AND EATING DISORDERS, AS WELL AS EVIDENCE-BASED COPING STRATEGIES. A VERSION OF KIT WAS BUILT AS A RESEARCH PROTOTYPE TO DELIVER THESE CONVERSATIONS. SIX FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED USING ONLINE SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS TO SEEK FEEDBACK ON THE KIT PROTOTYPE. THIS INCLUDED FOUR GROUPS OF PEOPLE SEEKING HELP FOR THEMSELVES (N=17; AGE 13-18 YEARS) AND TWO GROUPS OF PARENTS/CARERS (N=8; AGE 46-57 YEARS). PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED FEEDBACK ON THE CARTOON CHATBOT CHARACTER DESIGN, AS WELL AS THE CONTENT, STRUCTURE, AND DESIGN OF THE CHATBOT WEBCHAT. RESULTS: THEMATIC ANALYSES IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING THREE MAIN THEMES FROM THE SIX FOCUS GROUPS: (1) CHATBOT CHARACTER AND DESIGN, (2) CONTENT PRESENTATION, AND (3) FLOW. OVERALL, THE PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED POSITIVE FEEDBACK REGARDING KIT, WITH BOTH YOUNG PEOPLE AND PARENTS/CARERS GENERALLY PROVIDING SIMILAR REFLECTIONS. THE PARTICIPANTS APPROVED OF KIT'S CHARACTER AND ENGAGEMENT. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE REGARDING THE BREVITY AND TONE TO INCREASE KIT'S INTERACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: FOCUS GROUPS PROVIDED OVERALL POSITIVE QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK REGARDING THE CONTENT, STRUCTURE, AND DESIGN OF THE BODY IMAGE CHATBOT. INCORPORATING THE FEEDBACK OF LIVED EXPERIENCE FROM BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND PARENTS/CARERS ALLOWED THE REFINEMENT OF KIT IN THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE AS PER AN ITERATIVE AGILE METHODOLOGY.

THIS ARCHITECTURE CAN BE USED TO SIMULATE THREE ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE: A) DRIVER'S ENVIRONMENT; B) PEDESTRIAN ENVIRONMENT; C) VEHICLE TRAFFIC OBSERVER ENVIRONMENT. ALL THESE ENVIRONMENTS ARE CONTROLLED BY INTELLIGENT AGENTS THAT ALLOW THE USER TO HANDLE THE AUTONOMOUS LONGITUDINAL CONTROL, THE RELATIVE DISTANCE, THE SPEED OF THE CARS, THE COLLISIONS BETWEEN VEHICLES, THE PEDESTRIAN COLLISION, EXCESS OF THE SPEED LIMIT, CIRCULATION IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, AND RESPECT OF TRAFFIC SIGNALS. OUR SOLUTION TO TRAFFIC PROBLEMS HAS BEEN VALIDATED BY THE EXECUTION OF SEVERAL TESTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS SIMULATION APPLICATION ENCOURAGES LEARNING IN ROAD SAFETY EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN 9 AND 12 YEARS OLD, USING A DISTRIBUTED ENVIRONMENT WITH A COMPUTATIONAL CLUSTER IN THE CLOUD.";"DRIVING SIMULATOR; PEDESTRIAN SIMULATION; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; SERIOUS 3D GAME; ROAD SAFETY EDUCATION";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"UNIVERSIDAD DE LAS FUERZAS ARMADAS ESPE AS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCES; UNIVERSIDAD DE LAS FUERZAS ARMADAS ESPE AS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONICS, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS";"THE FUNDING OF THIS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY UNIVERSIDAD DE LAS FUERZAS ARMADAS ESPE, AS PART OF THE RESEARCH BUDGET OF BOTH DEPARTMENTS, COMPUTER SCIENCES AND ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONICS, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS.";NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;"ANONYMOUS, 2018, TELEGRAFO;BACKLUND P, 2010, SIMULAT GAMING, V41, P145, DOI 10.1177/1046878107311455;BECK K., 2004, XP SER;CALHEIROS R., 2010, J SOFTWARE PRACTICE;CONNOLLY T.

WE USED EXTREME PROGRAMING AGILE METHODOLOGY COMBINED WITH A PROPOSAL OF THE MODIFIED ELEMENTAL TETRAD GAME DESIGN MODEL TO DEVELOP A VIDEO GAME KNOWN AS \"TIC-TAC-TOE\". THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL WAS IMPLEMENTED WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS AND A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE INCLUDING SEMIOTICS; THIS WAS OPTIMIZED FOR PRODUCING AN ENJOYABLE AND INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THE PURPOSE OF STIMULATING COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN, THIS RESEARCH COMBINES THEORIES ABOUT STIMULATING COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN; GAME DESIGN MODEL, SEMIOTIC ANALYSIS HARNESSES THE MODEL OF ALEFERENKO, AND USES ALGORITHMS BASED ON HEURISTICS AND NUMERICAL METHODS IN CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE.

OBJECTIVE: ALTHOUGH A MYRIAD OF RESEARCH EXISTS ON SOFTWARE ANALYTICS AS WELL AS ON AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (ASD) PRACTICE ON ITSELF, THERE EXISTS NO SYSTEMATIC OVERVIEW OF THE RESEARCH DONE ON ASD FROM A DATA ANALYTICS PERSPECTIVE. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO MAKE PROGRESS BY LINKING ASD WITH BIG DATA ANALYTICS (BDA). METHOD: AS THE PRIMARY METHOD TO FIND RELEVANT LITERATURE ON THE TOPIC, WE PERFORMED MANUAL SEARCH AND SNOWBALLING ON PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2011 AND 2019. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 88 PRIMARY STUDIES WERE SELECTED AND ANALYZED. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT BDA IS EMPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ASD LIFECYCLE. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT DATA-DRIVEN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS FOCUSED ON THE FOLLOWING AREAS: CODE REPOSITORY ANALYTICS, DEFECTS/BUG FIXING, TESTING, PROJECT MANAGEMENT ANALYTICS, AND APPLICATION USAGE ANALYTICS. CONCLUSIONS: AS BDA AND ASD ARE FAST-DEVELOPING AREAS, IMPROVING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAMS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES BDA IS FACING IN THE INDUSTRY. THIS STUDY PROVIDES SCHOLARS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE OF SOFTWARE ANALYTICS RESEARCH AND THE CURRENT TRENDS AS WELL AS APPLICATIONS IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.

COUPLING THIS FRAMEWORK WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF SECURITY AS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FURTHER ENHANCES THE EFFICACY OF AN INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT, SECURITY, AND OPERATIONS (DEVSECOPS) TEAM WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS TO DELIVER SECURED DIGITAL SOLUTIONS. AIR NAVIGATION SERVICE PROVIDERS (ANSPS) AROUND THE WORLD ARE CURRENTLY EXPLORING AND EMBRACING THE DIGITAL EVOLUTION SHIFTING FROM MONOLITHIC, LEGACY AUTOMATION PLATFORMS TO AN APPLICATION FRAMEWORK OF MICROSERVICES TO ALLOW FOR FLEXIBLE OPERATIONS AS CAPABILITIES AND AIRSPACE OPERATIONS EVOLVE. SPECIFIC TO THE US, THE ATM AUTOMATION SYSTEM OF TODAY IS COMPRISED OF BOTH SAFETY AND NON-SAFETY CRITICAL SYSTEMS, WITH MISSION-ESSENTIAL, EFFICIENCY-CRITICAL, AND MISSION-SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE PREDOMINATELY MAINTAINED AND EVOLVED THROUGH MULTIYEAR, ONE CONTRACTOR-LED PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM HAS PROVEN RESILIENT, IT HAS NOT PROVEN TO BE AGILE AND FLEXIBLE TO ALLOW FOR ADVANCES IN CAPABILITIES ON-BOARD AIRCRAFT OR IN THE DATA INTEGRATION AND SHARING WITH OTHER NAS AUTOMATION SYSTEMS. THIS CREATES SIGNIFICANT OVERHEAD IN DEVELOPMENT, SUSTAINABILITY, AND OPERATIONS OF THE CURRENT AUTOMATION SYSTEM, AND LEAVES MODERNIZATION EFFORTS-IN TERMS OF NEW CAPABILITIES-IN CONSTANT INVESTMENT DECISION PLANNING CYCLES, COSTING AGENCIES NOT JUST MONEY, BUT MORE TIME TO INNOVATE. TO ADVANCE AVIATION INTO A NEW GENERATION OF INTEROPERABILITY LEVERAGING COLLABORATIVE FRAMEWORKS AND APPLICATION SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES, ANSPS MUST ADAPT TO INNOVATIVE METHODS TO COLLECT, PROCESS, AND DELIVER CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL AERONAUTICAL, WEATHER, AND FLIGHT INFORMATION TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OPERATORS AND ULTIMATELY TO AIRSPACE USERS. DOING SO CAN NOT ONLY LEAD TO SUSTAINING NAS AUTOMATION SYSTEMS WHILE REDUCING THE COSTS TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE THESE SYSTEMS, BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT STRATEGIES ON HOW TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE TIME AND INTEGRATION EFFORTS NEEDED TO DEPLOY NEW CAPABILITIES. LEVERAGING CLOUD-NATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES IS A WAY TO REALIZE THIS AUTOMATION EVOLUTION VISION FOR ANSPS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE MIGRATION FROM TODAY'S SYSTEMS TO SECURE, CLOUD-NATIVE PLATFORMS TO PROVE THAT MISSION SERVICES AND MISSION APPLICATIONS CAN BE RAPIDLY AVAILABLE / DEPLOYABLE TO OPERATORS WHO PROVIDE SEPARATION AND FLOW MANAGEMENT SERVICES, USING A CYBER-SECURED CLOUD-NATIVE ENVIRONMENT. AERONAUTICAL DATA TYPICALLY USED FOR TACTICAL DECISION MAKING IS NOW SEEN AS CRUCIAL TO THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT (ATM). INTEGRATING GLOBAL AND LOCALIZED DATASETS INTO A DIGITAL AVIATION DATA PLATFORM ENHANCES THE CAPABILITIES OF THE SOLUTIONS AND OPENS THE POSSIBILITIES OF LEVERAGING BIG DATA ANALYTICS AND MICROSERVICES TO COMPUTE TRAJECTORY PREDICTIONS (TP), DEMAND CAPACITY BALANCING (DCB), ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE SEQUENCING, AIRSPACE DELAY, AMONG OTHERS, IN REAL-TIME TO ACHIEVE OPERATOR-DRIVEN MISSION OBJECTIVES.

HOWEVER, APART FROM THIS, SOME OTHER SDLC MODELS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR SELECTION IN FRONT OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP ANY SOFTWARE. USUALLY, PROJECT MANAGERS SELECT ANY OF THESE MODELS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE THROUGH THEIR PAST EXPERIENCES. THERE IS NO LOGICAL BASIS FOR THIS SELECTION TO BE COMPLETELY CORRECT, AS A RESULT OF WHICH THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK OF SOFTWARE FAILURE OR OVER BUDGET IF AN INAPPROPRIATE MODEL HAS OPTED. KEEPING THIS PROBLEM OF SOFTWARE INDUSTRIES IN MIND, AN IDEAL SDLC MODEL HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED MATHEMATICALLY IN THIS ARTICLE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE APPLIED THE FUZZY TOPSIS METHOD THAT VALIDATES AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AS AN IDEAL CHOICE. WE HAVE TAKEN A TOTAL OF SIX SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES THAT ARE BEING APPLIED GLOBALLY.

UNDERSTANDING HOW TO CO-CREATE DIGITAL SERVICES WITH USERS, WHETHER THEY ARE CUSTOMERS OR FUTURE CUSTOMERS. THIS ABILITY COMBINES OBSERVATION, DIALOGUE, AND ITERATIVE EXPERIMENTATION. THE APPROACH PROPOSED IN THIS BOOK IS BASED ON THE LEAN STARTUP APPROACH, ACCORDING TO AN EXTENDED VISION THAT COMBINES DESIGN THINKING AND GROWTH HACKING. COMPANIES MUST BECOME TRULY \"CUSTOMER-CENTRIC\", FROM OBSERVATION AND LISTENING TO CO-DEVELOPMENT. THE REVOLUTION OF THE DIGITAL AGE OF THE 21ST CENTURY IS THAT CUSTOMER ORIENTATION IS MORE IMPERATIVE -- THE ERA OF ABUNDANCE, USAGES RATE OF CHANGE, COMPLEXITY OF EXPERIENCES, AND SHIFT OF POWER TOWARDS COMMUNITIES -- ARE EASIER, USING DIGITAL TOOLS AND DIGITAL COMMUNITIES. 2. DEVELOPING AN INFORMATION SYSTEM (IS) THAT IS THE BACKBONE OF THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION - CALLED \"EXPONENTIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM\" TO DESIGNATE AN OPEN IS (IN PARTICULAR ON ITS BORDERS), CAPABLE OF INTERFACING AND COMBINING WITH EXTERNAL SERVICES, POSITIONED AS A PLAYER IN SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEMS AND BUILT FOR PROCESSING SCALABLE AND DYNAMIC DATA FLOWS. THE EXPONENTIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND IT CONTINUOUSLY ABSORBS THE BEST OF INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING. 3. BUILDING SOFTWARE \"MICRO-FACTORIES\" THAT PRODUCE SERVICE PLATFORMS, WHICH ARE CALLED \"LEAN SOFTWARE FACTORIES.\" THIS \"SOFTWARE FACTORY\" CONCEPT COVERS THE INTEGRATION OF AGILE METHODS, TOOLING AND CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AND DEPLOYMENT PRACTICES, A CUSTOMER-ORIENTED PRODUCT APPROACH, AND A PLATFORM APPROACH BASED ON MODULARITY, AS WELL AS API-BASED ARCHITECTURE AND OPENNESS TO EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. THIS SOFTWARE MICRO-FACTORY IS THE FOUNDATION THAT CONTINUOUSLY PRODUCES AND PROVIDES CONSTANTLY EVOLVING SERVICES. THESE THREE CAPABILITIES ARE NOT UNIQUE OR SPECIFIC TO THIS BOOK, THEY ARE LINKED TO OTHER CONCEPTS SUCH AS AGILE METHODS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACCORDING TO LEAN PRINCIPLES, SOFTWARE PRODUCTION APPROACHES SUCH AS CICD (CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION AND DEPLOYMENT) OR DEVOPS. THIS BOOK WEAVES A COMMON FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR ALL THESE APPROACHES TO DERIVE MORE VALUE FROM THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND TO FACILITATE ITS IMPLEMENTATION. THE TITLE OF THE BOOK REFERS TO THE \"LEAN APPROACH TO DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION\" BECAUSE THE TWO UNDERLYING FRAMEWORKS, LEAN STARTUP AND LEAN SOFTWARE FACTORY, ARE DIRECTLY INSPIRED BY LEAN, IN THE SENSE OF THE TOYOTA WAY. THE LEAN APPROACH IS PRESENT FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THIS BOOK -- IT PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR CUSTOMER ORIENTATION AND THE LOVE OF A JOB WELL DONE, WHICH ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. © 2022 YVES CASEAU.

THE FOCUS IS TO OPTIMIZE THE CONVENTIONAL THREAT MODELING APPROACH TO EXPLORE SOFTWARE SYSTEM VULNERABILITIES. DATA PRODUCED IN THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES ARE BETTER LEVERAGED USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES. A LARGE AMOUNT OF INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE AROUND SECURITY VULNERABILITIES CAN BE LEVERAGED TO ENHANCE CURRENT THREAT MODELING APPROACHES. WORK DONE HERE IS IN THE ECOSYSTEM OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES THAT USE AGILE METHODOLOGY. INSURANCE BUSINESS DOMAIN DATA ARE EXPLORED AS A TARGET FOR THIS STUDY. THE FOCUS IS TO ENHANCE THE TRADITIONAL THREAT MODELING APPROACH WITH A BETTER QUANTITATIVE APPROACH AND REDUCE THE BIASES INTRODUCED BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES. THIS EFFORT WILL HELP BRIDGE MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES PREVALENT ACROSS THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ECOSYSTEM. BRINGING THESE VARIOUS DATA SOURCES TOGETHER WILL ASSIST IN UNDERSTANDING PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITY ASPECTS OF THE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS. THIS PERSPECTIVE FURTHER HELPS TO UNDERSTAND AND DEVISE BETTER CONTROLS. APPROACHES EXPLORED SO FAR HAVE CONSIDERED INDIVIDUAL AREAS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON IMPROVING SECURITY. THERE IS A NEED TO BUILD AN INTEGRATED APPROACH FOR A TOTAL SECURITY SOLUTION FOR THE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS. A WIDE VARIETY OF MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES AND ENSEMBLE APPROACHES WILL BE EXPLORED. THE INSURANCE BUSINESS DOMAIN IS CONSIDERED FOR THE RESEARCH HERE. CWE (COMMON WEAKNESSES ENUMERATION) MAPPING FROM INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE ARE LEVERAGED TO VALIDATE THE SECURITY NEEDS FROM THE INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE. THIS COMBINATION OF INDUSTRY AND COMPANY DATA WILL HELP GET A HOLISTIC PICTURE OF THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM'S SECURITY. COMBINING THE INDUSTRY AND COMPANY DATA HELPS LAY DOWN THE PATH FOR AN INTEGRATED SECURITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK WITH THE QUANTITATIVE THREAT MODELING PROCESS IS THE WORK'S UNIQUENESS.

HERE WE PRESENT AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO THE DIGITALIZATION OF AN O&G PLANT AIMING TO OFFER OPERATOR SAFETY ENHANCEMENT, PRODUCTION OPTIMIZATION AND REDUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TO MAXIMIZE THE ASSET VALUE. THIS HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY COMPLEX AND CONTINUOUS WORK POWERED BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE ENGINE AND THE REAL TARGET OF THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PROCESS. IN THE KEY STUDY HEREBY PRESENTED, AN ALL-ROUND EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO EMPOWER THE OPERATOR'S EVERYDAY WORK WITH DIGITAL AND INNOVATIVE TOOLS SUPPORTING RESERVOIR, MAINTENANCE, PRODUCTION AND HSE WORKFLOW. STARTING FROM A NUMBER OF VARIOUS LEGACY SYSTEMS, A SINGLE INTEGRATED DASHBOARD WAS BUILT: THE INTEGRATED OPERATION CENTRE (IOC). IOC IS NOW AVAILABLE ON PC AND SMARTPHONES TO ALL SITE PERSONNEL BOTH AT THE OPERATIONAL AND MANAGERIAL LEVEL. NEW INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS WERE DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED INTO IOC TO CAPITALIZE ON THE DATA ACQUIRED DURING YEARS OF PLANT ACTIVITIES. MACHINE LEARNING AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS SOLUTIONS PROVIDE NEW DAILY INSIGHT ON HOW TO EFFICIENTLY SCHEDULE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS AND AVOID OFF-SPECS AND DOWNTIME ON CRITICAL EQUIPMENT, WHILE COMPLEX PRODUCTION OPTIMIZERS HELP TECHNICIANS REACT TO UNEXPECTED SITUATIONS AND MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION. VIA IOT (INTERNET OF THINGS) AND PORTABLE DEVICES, NEW TOOLS AND WORKFLOWS WERE DEPLOYED ONSITE TO EASE THE WORK AND ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF WORKERS WITH FOCUS ON USAGE OF PPE AND PROVIDING RAPID INFORMATION TO LOCATE WORKERS DURING EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. PEOPLE FROM BOTH SITE AND COMPANY HEADQUARTERS ENSURED THE SUCCESS OF THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION BY WORKING TOGETHER IN AN AGILE METHOD DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE AND BY COACHING IN THE ROLL-OUT PHASE. NEW PROFESSIONAL ROLES, LIKE DATA SCIENTIST AND BIG DATA ENGINEERS, JOINED EFFORT WITH EXPERIENCED OPERATORS TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THIS JOURNEY. THIS COOPERATION WAS AT THE BASIS OF A COMPREHENSIVE CHANGE MANAGEMENT EFFORT, WHICH ENSURED A SMOOTH AND CONSTANT CHANGE IN THE WAY THE PERSONNEL THINKS, ACTS AND REACTS. THIS, WE BELIEVE, IS AT THE VERY HEART OF ANY FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION, BEING IT DIGITAL OR NOT.

IT IS BASIC TO GIVE AS EXACT A GAUGE AS COULD REALLY BE EXPECTED. TODAY, IN THE DATA INNOVATION BUSINESS, FOR ASSESSMENT IN SPRY PROGRAMMING ADVANCEMENT, MOST OF THE PART IS DEPENDENT ON HEURISTIC METHODOLOGIES LIKE MASTER JUDGMENT AND ARRANGING POKER. IT IS VERY HARD TO GAUGE COORDINATED PROGRAMMING ADVANCEMENT WITHOUT NIMBLE MASTERY. VARIOUS STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS TO EVALUATE SOFTWARE EFFORT ESTIMATING METHODOLOGIES, BUT BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF NEW SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES, THE REVIEWS HAVE NOT BEEN CAUGHT UP WITH THEM. THIS ARTICLE GIVES AN INTENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF COST ASSESSMENT IN AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WILL HELP THE CLIENTS IN UNDERSTANDING CURRENT EXPENSE ASSESSMENT DRIFTS IN ASD. MOST AGILE TEAMS ESTIMATE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT USING EXPERT ESTIMATING METHODOLOGIES, ACCORDING TO A THOROUGH LITERATURE ANALYSIS AND SURVEY. THIS WORK INCLUDES A THOROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW THAT HAS BEEN UPDATED BY EXAMINING DATA FROM 73 NEW STUDIES. THE MAJORITY OF THE DATA COMES FROM SINGLE-COMPANY DATABASES; HOWEVER, CROSS-COMPANY DATA IS EXTREMELY POPULAR. ESTIMATES OF EFFORT AND COST ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF A STUDY USING MODELS OR HISTORICAL DATA APPLIED TO SIZE, ACTIVITIES, AND OTHER PLANNING CHARACTERISTICS. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SPRINGER NATURE SINGAPORE PTE LTD.";"AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; COST; EFFORT; ESTIMATION; MACHINE LEARNING";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"FERNÁNDEZ-DIEGO, M., MÉNDEZ, E.R., GONZÁLEZ-LADRÓN-DE-GUEVARA, F., ABRAHÃO, S., INSFRAN, E., AN UPDATE ON EFFORT ESTIMATION IN AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW (2020) IEEE ACCESS, 8, PP. 166768-166800; TRENDOWICZ, A., JEFFERY, R., (2014) SOFTWARE PROJECT EFFORT ESTIMATION: FOUNDATIONS AND BEST PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR SUCCESS, , SPRINGER, BERLIN, GERMANY; GARG, S., GUPTA, D., PCA BASED COST ESTIMATION MODEL FOR AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (2015) 2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT (IEOM).

THIS SYSTEM MAINLY USED THE ESP32 IOT DEVELOPMENT BOARD AS ITS BRAIN. THE RESEARCHERS DEVELOPED I-DETECT PROJECT TO PROVIDE HOME AUTOMATION IN SMART LIGHTING AND SWITCHING, SMOKE AND FIRE DETECTION AND MITIGATION SYSTEMS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND MANAGEMENT. THE PROJECT USES A WATER-SCRUM-FALL APPROACH UNDER AGILE METHODOLOGY IN DEVELOPING THE SYSTEM SINCE IT INVOLVES INTEGRATION BETWEEN HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. DURING THE TESTS CONDUCTED IN THREE (3) TRIALS, THE RESULTS WERE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT PERFORMED ACCORDING TO THE INTENDED FUNCTION. THE VOICE-ACTIVATED HOME AUTOMATION CARRIED THE COMMANDS ACCORDINGLY; THE EXHAUST FANS ACTIVATED WHEN SMOKE/GAS WAS DETECTED, AND WATER PUMPS ACTIVATED WHEN A FIRE WAS DETECTED. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT AS LONG AS THE INTERNET CONNECTION IS STABLE THE HOME AUTOMATION WILL SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SMOKE/GAS AND FIRE DETECTION AND MITIGATION CAN STILL BE EXECUTED WITHOUT RELYING ON THE INTERNET CONNECTION. SMS NOTIFICATIONS WERE ALSO RESPONSIVE AS WELL AS THE REAL-TIME RESPONSIVE WEB SERVER. FOR A BETTER UPGRADE OF THIS SYSTEM, THE RESEARCHERS RECOMMEND A BETTER PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD (PCB) DESIGN THAT IS READY FOR MASS PRODUCTION. © 2021 IEEE.";"ARDUINO HOME AUTOMATION; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI); ESP32; INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT)";"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; AUTOMATION; FIRE DETECTORS; FIRES; PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS; SMOKE; SPEECH RECOGNITION; ARDUINO HOME AUTOMATION; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; ESP32; FIRE DETECTION SYSTEMS; FIRE MITIGATION; HOME AUTOMATION; INTERNET CONNECTION; INTERNET OF THING; MITIGATION SYSTEMS; SMOKE DETECTION; INTERNET OF THINGS";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"JAMADAGNI, S., SANKPAL, P., PATIL, S., CHOUGULE, N., GURAV, S., GAS LEAKAGE AND FIRE DETECTION USING RASPBERRY PI (2019) 2019 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING METHODOLOGIES AND COMMUNICATION (ICCMC), PP. 495-497. , ERODE, INDIA; CARDUCCI, C.G.C., MONTI, A., SCHRAVEN, M.H., SCHUMACHER, M., MUELLER, D., ENABLING ESP32-BASED IOT APPLICATIONS IN BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEMS (2019) 2019 II WORKSHOP ON METROLOGY FOR INDUSTRY 4.0 AND IOT (METROIND4.0&IOT), PP. 306-311. , NAPLES, ITALY; KODALI, R.K., GREESHMA, R.N.V., NIMMANAPALLI, K.P., BORRA, Y.K.Y., IOT BASED INDUSTRIAL PLANT SAFETY GAS LEAKAGE DETECTION SYSTEM (2018) 2018 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING COMMUNICATION AND AUTOMATION (ICCCA), PP. 1-5. , GREATER NOIDA, INDIA; MITTAL, Y., TOSHNIWAL, P., SHARMA, S., SINGHAL, D., GUPTA, R., MITTAL, V.K., A VOICE-CONTROLLED MULTI-FUNCTIONAL SMART HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM (2015) 2015 ANNUAL IEEE INDIA CONFERENCE (INDICON), PP. 1-6. , NEW DELHI; LISTYORINI, T., (2018) A PROTOTYPE FIRE DETECTION IMPLEMENTED USING THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND FUZZY LOGIC; RYU, C.S., IOT-BASED INTELLIGENT FOR FIRE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEMS (2015) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SMART HOME, 9, PP. 161-168; SNEHA MATRIAYA, R.P., VOICE CONTROLLED HOME AUTOMATION USING AMAZON ECHO DOT (2018) IOSR JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING (IOSR-JCE), 20 (3), PP. 16-19; YUE, C.Z., PING, S., VOICE ACTIVATED SMART HOME DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION (2017) 2017 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FRONTIERS OF SENSORS TECHNOLOGIES (ICFST), PP. 489-492. , SHENZHEN; GANDHI, B., SHETH, K., (2019) SYSTEMS AND METHODS TO SEAMLESSLY CONNECT INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) DEVICES TO MULTIPLE INTELLIGENT VOICE ASSISTANTS, , SEP, PATENT NO.

ONE PROPOSED SOLUTION TO IMPROVE GOVERNMENTAL DIGITAL SERVICE DEVELOPMENT IS FOR GOVERNMENTS TO UTILIZE AGILE DEVELOPMENT METHODS.

FIRST, WHETHER OR NOT AGILE DEVELOPMENT MIGHT HELP TO OVERCOME COMMON FAILURE REASONS OF DIGITAL GOVERNMENT PROJECTS. SECOND, WHAT THE CHALLENGES AND SUCCESS FACTORS OF AGILE DIGITAL GOVERNMENT SERVICE DEVELOPMENT ARE. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES BOTH OF THESE GAPS. BY GATHERING INSIGHTS FROM SIX CASES WHERE AGILE METHODS WERE USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DIGITAL SERVICES, IT IDENTIFIES FIVE CORE CATEGORIES OF CHALLENGES AND SUCCESS FACTORS ENCOUNTERED WHEN UTILIZING AGILE DEVELOPMENT METHODS FOR GOVERNMENTAL DIGITAL SERVICE DEVELOPMENT: ORGANIZATIONAL, METHODOLOGICAL, END-USER-RELATED, TECHNOLOGICAL, AND REGULATORY.

PROFIT AND NOT-FOR PROFIT FIRMS, INSTITUTIONS, AND ORGANIZATIONS, IN GENERAL, FACE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS RELATED TO KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT. DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OFFER A WIDE ARRAY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR VALUE CREATION. AT THE SAME TIME, ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO FOSTER NEWER, FASTER, AND MORE DYNAMIC WAYS OF MOBILIZING AND MANAGING KNOWLEDGE. EMERGING TRENDS, SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE, AGILE METHODOLOGIES, OPEN INNOVATION, AND CO-CREATION ENABLE NEW BUSINESS MODELS AND MANAGERIAL PARADIGMS THAT NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND CONCEPTUALIZED. THIS BOOK OFFERS AN EXTENSIVE OVERVIEW OF THE MOST RECENT TRENDS IN KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND THE MOST ADVANCED THEORETICAL APPROACHES, WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, PROVIDING A WIDE ARRAY OF CASE STUDIES AND EVIDENCE-BASED KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN ICT AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES, IN TERMS OF HUMAN/NON-HUMAN INTERACTIONS, WHICH REQUIRES EXTRAORDINARY ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE AND RENEWAL. FURTHER, THE BOOK PRESENTS AN UP-TO-DATE EXAMINATION OF AND GUIDANCE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN AN ERA OF UNPRECEDENTED HUMAN/NON-HUMAN INTERACTION. THE BOOK CONVEYS THE RESULTS OF MORE THAN A DECADE OF RESEARCH AND APPLIED EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CARRIED OUT BY THE AUTHOR. IT IS INTENDED NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS AND ACADEMICS BUT ALSO FOR MANAGERS AND PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DEEPENING THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING. © 2020 LUCIA MARCHEGIANI";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"ACCIARINI, C., BOLICI, F., MARCHEGIANI, L., PIROLO, L., ;

CONSIDERING THE EFFECT OF MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN 2020, TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME EVEN MORE INFLUENTIAL. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE VERY RAPID DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING, INTERNET OF THINGS, MACHINE LEARNING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND 5G AND CONSEQUENTLY THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS UPSKILLING OF EXPERT HUMAN RESOURCES HAVE MADE THE ADAPTATION OF TRADITIONAL LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODS TO THIS NEW HUMAN CONDITION A VITAL ISSUE. WHILE THE AFOREMENTIONED PHENOMENON IS BEING EXPERIENCED, A TALENT GAP IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE COMPETENCIES OF THE GRADUATES OF COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING, SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND OTHER RELATED DEPARTMENTS AND INDUSTRY EXPECTATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION APPROACHES OF THE UNIVERSITIES. THE SHORTENING OF THE LIFESPAN OF THE PRODUCED VOCATIONAL KNOWLEDGE DAY BY DAY CONTINUES TO INCREASE THIS GAP. FOR THIS REASON, IT HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN APPROACH THAT IS MORE SUITABLE FOR THIS DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS STUDY, IT HAS BEEN EXAMINED WHETHER THE AGILE METHODS, WHICH HAVE BECOME WIDESPREAD WITHIN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IN THE LAST 15 YEARS, HAVE SIMILAR POTENTIAL WHEN USED AS A TRAINING METHOD. DURING THE STUDY, 49 STUDENTS FROM THE ENGINEERING FACULTY OF A TURKISH UNIVERSITY PARTICIPATED IN THE \"AGILE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\"COURSE. THE CURRICULUM DESIGN, LEARNING EXPERIENCES, STUDENT PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE OTHER RESULTS HAVE BEEN SHARED. IN THIS COURSE, 3 SPRINTS ARE DESIGNED WITH 8 AGILE PROJECT TEAMS THAT ARE SELF-ORGANIZED WITH THE SCRUM FRAMEWORK. CONTINUOUS TEAM LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES WERE EVALUATED AND THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN APPLYING \"AGILITY\"APPROACH TO STUDENTS WHILE DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND THE EFFECT OF AGILE METHOD ON THE PERFORMANCE OF LEARNING WERE EXAMINED.

FOR OLDER PEOPLE, SELF-ISOLATION PRESENTS PARTICULAR CHALLENGES FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. AS TIME PROGRESSES, CONTINUED SOCIAL DISTANCING COULD HAVE A COMPOUNDING IMPACT ON THESE CONCERNS. OBJECTIVE: THIS PROJECT AIMS TO PROVIDE A TOOL FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND PEERS TO IMPROVE THEIR WELL-BEING AND HEALTH DURING AND AFTER REGULATED SOCIAL DISTANCING. FIRST, WE WILL EVALUATE THE TOOL’S FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND USABILITY TO ENCOURAGE POSITIVE NUTRITION, ENHANCE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND ENABLE VIRTUAL INTERACTION WHILE SOCIAL DISTANCING. SECOND, WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THE APP TO PROVIDE AN ONLINE COMMUNITY TO ASSIST FAMILIES AND PEER GROUPS IN MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH OLDER PEOPLE USING GOAL SETTING. ANONYMIZED DATA FROM THE APP WILL BE AGGREGATED WITH OTHER REAL-WORLD DATA SOURCES TO DEVELOP A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM TO IMPROVE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 AND TRACK FOR REAL TIME USE BY HEALTH SYSTEMS. METHODS: DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROJECT IS OCCURRING AT THE TIME OF PUBLICATION, AND THEREFORE, A CASE STUDY DESIGN WAS SELECTED TO PROVIDE A SYSTEMATIC MEANS OF CAPTURING SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IN PROGRESS. THE APP DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK FOR SOFTWARE DESIGN WAS BASED ON AGILE METHODS. THE EVALUATION OF THE APP’S FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND USABILITY SHALL BE CONDUCTED USING PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND'S GUIDANCE ON EVALUATING DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS, BANDURA’S MODEL OF HEALTH PROMOTION, THE REACH EFFECTIVENESS ADOPTION IMPLEMENTATION MAINTENANCE (RE-AIM) FRAMEWORK AND THE NONADOPTION, ABANDONMENT AND CHALLENGES TO THE SCALE-UP, SPREAD AND SUITABILITY (NASSS) FRAMEWORK. RESULTS: MAKING USE OF A PRE-EXISTING SOFTWARE FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE, A PROOF OF CONCEPT WAS DEVELOPED, AND A MULTISTAGE APP DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT FOR THE SOLUTION WAS CREATED. GRANT SUBMISSIONS TO FUND THE PROJECT AND STUDY EXECUTION HAVE BEEN SOUGHT AT THE TIME OF PUBLICATION, AND PREDISCOVERY ITERATION OF THE SOLUTION HAS BEGUN. ETHICAL APPROVAL FOR A FEASIBILITY STUDY DESIGN IS BEING SOUGHT. CONCLUSIONS: THIS CASE STUDY LAYS THE FOUNDATIONS FOR FUTURE APP DEVELOPMENT TO COMBAT MENTAL AND SOCIETAL ISSUES ARISING FROM SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES. THE APP WILL BE TESTED AND EVALUATED IN FUTURE STUDIES TO ALLOW CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF THE APP. THIS NOVEL CONTRIBUTION WILL PROVIDE AN EVIDENCE-BASED EXEMPLAR FOR FUTURE APP DEVELOPMENT IN THE SPACE OF SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS. © EDWARD MEINERT.";"ACCESS; AGED; AGILE; APP; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; CELLPHONE; CORONAVIRUS; COVID-19; DATA SCIENCE; DIGITAL HEALTH; EVALUATION; EXERCISE; HEALTH CARE QUALITY; INFORMATION SCIENCE; MENTAL HEALTH; PUBLIC REPORTING OF HEALTHCARE DATA; REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING; SOCIAL DISTANCING; TELEMEDICINE";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"(2020) GUIDANCE ON SOCIAL DISTANCING FOR EVERYONE IN THE UK, , HTTPS://WWW.GOV.UK/GOVERNMENT/PUBLICATIONS/COVID-19-GUIDANCE-ON-SOCIAL-DISTANCING-AND-FOR-VULNERABLE-PEOPLE/GUIDANCE-ON-SOCIAL-DISTANCING-FOR-EVERYONE-IN-THE-UK-AND-PROTECTING-OLDER-PEOPLE-AND-VULNERABLE-ADULTS, GOV.UK.

STRATEGIC INNOVATION INVOLVES HIGH UNCERTAINTIES BETTER ADDRESSED THROUGH AGILE METHODS AND A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH [1–3]. KEY SUCCESS FACTORS IN DELIVERING ITO/BPO INNOVATION ARE HIGH-QUALITY RELATIONSHIPS, TRUST AND COLLABORATIVE CULTURES [1–4], AND ESTABLISHING AN EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE CONFIGURATION. THE AUTHORS REPORT ON LONGITUDINAL CASE STUDIES OF A GLOBAL MINING COMPANY (“GMC”) AND A GROUP OF ITS SUPPLIERS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING HOW GMC IS DEVELOPING “BIG DATA” APPLICATIONS TO GENERATE GAME-CHANGING INNOVATION. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES HOW GMC HAS DEVELOPED A “BIG DATA” PLATFORM TO SUPPORT INTERNAL STAFF, CUSTOMERS, CONSULTANTS AND THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS TO CREATE APPLICATIONS THAT CAN TRANSFORM GLOBAL MINING AND SMELTING INDUSTRIES TO DELIVER A PRICE PREMIUM FOR GMC’S PRODUCTS. GMC HAS ENCOUNTERED A SHORTAGE OF SUITABLY EXPERIENCED DATA SCIENTISTS IN ITS KEY OPERATING LOCATIONS RESULTING IN A SIGNIFICANT SKILLS GAP IN ITS BIG DATA PROGRAM. GMC’S SOURCING STRATEGY AIMS TO BUILD AN OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE ECOSYSTEM THAT DRAWS UPON SECONDARY MARKETS TO HELP FILL THE SKILLS GAP. TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH OPEN INNOVATION [5] CAN FLOURISH, GMC ESTABLISHED AN ANALYTICS SPEED TEAM (AST) AS AN INTERNAL CONSULTING AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT GROUP TO DRIVE FASTER PROGRESS WITH BIG DATA APPLICATIONS. A CONTRIBUTION OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF AST IN ESTABLISHING AN EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE CONFIGURATION FOR OPEN INNOVATION.

COMPANIES THAT OFFER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO PEOPLE MUST IMPLEMENT METHODOLOGIES THAT FACILITATE AND SPEED UP THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS TO SATISFY THE CUSTOMER. THAT IS, BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP THEIR TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE AND PROMOTE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. NOW, SEVERAL COMPANIES (NOT SOFTWARE INDUSTRY EXCLUSIVE) USE AGILE METHODOLOGIES SINCE THEY FACILITATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT SINCE IT ALLOWS THEM TO ACT QUICKLY IN THE FACE OF CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE PLANNING AND BUDGET. IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSED A PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THE SCRUM METHODOLOGY IN THE CIB ENGINEERING AREA IN BBVA COLOMBIA BY PHASES AND FOCUS ON PEOPLE'S ADAPTATION RATHER THAN THE PROCESS. DURING THIS IMPLEMENTATION, WE OBSERVED SOME FACTORS THAT CAUSED DISSATISFACTION IN THE TEAM, BUT WHICH WERE OVERCOME AS PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE AND BENEFITS FROM THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE. IN ADDITION TO GETTING TEAM MEMBERS TO PLAY A ROLE AND FOLLOW THE FRAMEWORK'S RULES, OUR HIGHEST SATISFACTION IS THAT MOST OF THE TEAM, AFTER TWO ITERATIONS, IS WILLING TO TRANSFORM THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THEIR JOB. © 2020 COPYRIGHT FOR THIS PAPER BY ITS AUTHORS.";"AGILE; DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION; GOOD PRACTICES; SCRUM";"BUDGET CONTROL; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; INTERNATIONAL TRADE; SALES; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING; AGILE METHODOLOGIES; CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE; CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS; SCRUM METHODOLOGIES; SOFTWARE INDUSTRY; TEAM MEMBERS; TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS; WORLD MARKET; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"BARRIENTOS, G.

THUS, KNOWLEDGE DISSEMINATION/ACQUISITION BECOMES DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE FOUR INHERENT DISTANCES IN GSD, WHICH, IN TURN CAUSES AK VAPORIZATION. ONE WAY TO REDUCE THIS LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE AK TRACES THAT DIFFERENT UNSTRUCTURED AND TEXTUAL ELECTRONIC MEANS (UTEM) LEAVE (E.G. INSTANT MESSENGERS AND EMAIL), WHICH DEVELOPERS PREFER ON AGSD ENVIRONMENTS. THESE TRACES ARE VALUABLE, BUT THEIR ACCESS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THESE MEANS HAVE NO TOOLS ADAPTED TO SEARCH AK AND BECAUSE THIS KNOWLEDGE IS SCATTERED IN DIFFERENT UTEM. THE AK CONDENSATION CONCEPT PROPOSES THAT TROUGH A MECHANISM OF CLASSIFICATION AND COLLECTION OF MESSAGES CONTAINED IN UTEM, AK COULD BECOME AVAILABLE FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A SLACK COMPLEMENT, WHICH IMPLEMENTS AN AK CLASSIFICATION MECHANISM BASED ON SOCIAL TAGGING. WE EVALUATED THIS MECHANISM WITH UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS THROUGH A REPLICA OF A PREVIOUS STUDY. WE OBTAINED POSITIVE RESULTS IN REGARDS TO USEFULNESS AND EASE OF USE, BUT WITH TAGGING BEHAVIOR RESULTS THAT DIFFER (NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT) FROM THOSE OBTAINED PREVIOUSLY.

IN ORDER TO DESIGN AND PROPOSE QUALITY-ORIENTED APPS, IT IS THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEVELOPERS TO DEVOTE TIME AND SUFFICIENT EFFORTS TOWARDS TESTING TO MAKE THE APPS BUG FREE AND OPERATIONAL IN THE HANDS OF END USERS WITHOUT ANY HICCUP. IN ORDER TO TEST THE MOBILE APPS, MANUAL TESTING PROCEDURES TAKES PROLONGED AMOUNT OF TIME IN WRITING TEST CASES AND EVEN THE FULL TESTING REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET. IN ADDITION TO THIS, LACK OF SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE BY THE TESTER ALSO IMPACTS OVERALL QUALITY AND ASSURANCE THAT APP IS BUG FREE. TO OVERCOME ALL THE ISSUES OF TESTING, AND TO ASSURE THAT APPS DESIGNED BY DEVELOPERS ARE ALMOST BUG FREE, WE PROPOSE A NEW TESTING METHODOLOGY CUM TOOL 'AGILEUATM' WHICH WORKS PRIMARILY TOWARDS WHITE-BOX AND BLACK-BOX TESTING. WITH THIS TOOL, ALL THE TEST CASES ARE GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY BASED ON USER STORIES AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA BY USING FORMAL SPECIFICATION AND Z3 SMT SOLVERS. TO TEST THE VALIDITY OF THE PROPOSED TOOL, WE APPLIED THE TOOL IN REAL-TIME OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT WITH REGARD TO TEST MOBILE APPS. USING THIS TOOL, ALL THE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA IS DETERMINED VIA USER STORIES. THE TESTERS/DEVELOPERS SPECIFY REQUIREMENTS WITH FORMAL SPECIFICATIONS BASED ON PROGRAMS PROPERTIES, PREDICATES, INVARIANTS, AND CONSTRAINTS. FROM THE RESULTS, IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE PROPOSED TOOL I.E.

AS THE NUMBER OF NON-TECHNICAL BUSINESS PROFESSIONALS WHO WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS IS INCREASING, IT BECOMES IMPORTANT TO FIND EFFECTIVE TEACHING METHODS FOR NON-TECHNICAL ADULTS WHO NEED TO UNDERSTAND CORE TECHNICAL CONCEPTS IN WHICH THEY ARE INVOLVED REASONABLY. THE PROPOSED TEACHING METHOD UTILIZES THE ACTIVE USE OF VISUAL FEEDBACK AND AGILE PRACTICES TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES THE ADULT LEARNERS FACE. IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED TEACHING METHOD BY THE OPEN CODING METHOD TO ANALYZE THE FREE-FORM RESPONSES AND BY THE PAIRED T-TEST OVER THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS ASKED TO THE PARTICIPANTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE LECTURE. WE FOUND THAT THIS TEACHING METHOD EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTED THE LEARNERS TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIC TECHNICAL CONCEPTS OF AI WITHIN ONE OR TWO-DAY TIME FRAME. WE ALSO CONFIRMED THE NON-TECHNICAL ADULT LEARNERS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD UNDERSTANDING AI FROM INITIALLY NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE WITH A GOOD EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS IN UNDERSTANDING AI, WHICH IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT OUTCOMES FOR THE LEARNERS AS THE EXPECTANCY-VALUE THEORY PREDICTS THEIR FUTURE PERFORMANCE ON UNDERSTANDING AI. © 2019 IEEE.";"ADULT LEARNERS; AGILE METHOD; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; PROGRAMMING; STORYTELLING; TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION; VISUAL METHOD";"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; INFORMATION DISSEMINATION; MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING; TEACHING; VISUAL COMMUNICATION; ADULT LEARNERS; AGILE METHODS; STORYTELLING; TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION; VISUAL METHOD; LEARNING SYSTEMS";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"GUO, P.J., OLDER ADULTS LEARNING COMPUTER PROGRAMMING: MOTIVATIONS, FRUSTRATIONS, AND DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES (2017) PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS-CHI'17, PP. 7070-7083. , DENVER, COLORADO, USA; CHILANA, P.K., PERCEPTIONS OF NON-CS MAJORS IN INTRO PROGRAMMING: THE RISE OF THE CONVERSATIONAL PROGRAMMER (2015) 2015 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON VISUAL LANGUAGES AND HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING (VL/HCC), PP. 251-259. , ATLANTA, GA; CHILANA, P.K., SINGH, R., GUO, P.J., UNDERSTANDING CONVERSATIONAL PROGRAMMERS: A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, \" IN PROCEEDINGS OF THE (2016) 2016 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS-CHI'16, PP. 1462-1472. , SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, USA; WANG, A.Y., MITTS, R., GUO, P.J., CHILANA, P.K., MISMATCH OF EXPECTATIONS: HOW MODERN LEARNING RESOURCES FAIL CONVERSATIONAL PROGRAMMERS (2018) PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2018 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS-CHI'18, PP. 1-13. , MONTREAL QC, CANADA; BOSSE, Y., GEROSA, M.A., WHY IS PROGRAMMING SO DIFFICULT TO LEARN?: PATTERNS OF DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO PROGRAMMING LEARNING MID-STAGE (2017) SIGSOFT SOFTW ENG NOTES, 41 (6), PP. 1-6. , JAN; BUTLER, M., MORGAN, M., LEARNING CHALLENGES FACED BY NOVICE PROGRAMMING STUDENTS STUDYING HIGH LEVEL AND LOW FEEDBACK CONCEPTS, P. 9; WIGFIELD, A., ECCLES, J.S., EXPECTANCY-VALUE THEORY OF ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION (2000) CONTEMP.

THESE USER STORIES ARE THEN SCOPED IN VARIOUS SPRINT RELEASES AND DELIVERED ACCORDINGLY. RELEASE PLANNING IN AGILE BECOMES CHALLENGING WHEN THE NUMBER OF USER STORIES GOES UP IN HUNDREDS. IN SUCH SCENARIOS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MANUALLY IDENTIFY SIMILAR USER STORIES AND PACKAGE THEM TOGETHER INTO A RELEASE. HENCE, THIS PAPER SUGGESTS APPLICATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHMS FOR IDENTIFYING SIMILAR USER STORIES AND THEN SCOPING THEM INTO A RELEASE THIS PAPER TAKES THE APPROACH TO BUILD A WORD CORPUS FOR EVERY PROJECT RELEASE IDENTIFIED IN THE PROJECT AND THEN TO CONVERT THE PROVIDED USER STORIES INTO A VECTOR OF STRING USING JAVA UTILITY FOR CALCULATING TOP 3 MOST OCCURRING WORDS FROM THE GIVEN PROJECT CORPUS IN A USER STORY.

TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT), CLOUD, BLOCKCHAIN, DATA ANALYTICS, BIG DATA, ROBOTICS (AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, DRONES, RPA), ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI), MACHINE LEARNING (ML), DIGITAL TWINS, AR/VR HAS CATALYZED THIS TRANSFORMATION. FOR INSTANCE, THE DEPLOYMENT OF AI SYSTEMS TO HELP OPTIMIZE BAKKEN SHALE WELLS RUNNING ON SRP'S, IMPLEMENTATION OF BLOCKCHAIN DRILLING FOR WELL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES, VR/AR VISUALIZATION OF CANADA SAGD OILFIELDS, PROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO ESP USING REAL-TIME DATA ANALYTICS IN KAZAKHSTAN GAS CONDENSATE WELLS ARE SOME OF THE RECENT TRANSFORMATIONS THE INDUSTRY HAS WITNESSED. AS THE OIL AND GAS 4.0 SIMPLIFIES, MODERNIZING AND SECURING THE LEGACY ENVIRONMENTS FOR THE NEW DIGITAL ERA, A ROBUST DIGITAL ASSURANCE IS ESSENTIAL. DIGITAL ASSURANCE IS AN EXCLUSIVE DIGITAL SERVICE EMPLOYING AN END-TO-END ECOSYSTEM APPROACH WITH INTELLIGENT AND AUTOMATED PROCESSES TO GAIN QUALITY AND SPEED FOR PROMOTING FASTER BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY CHANGE AND BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. THE SERVICE SHALL OFFER EVALUATION OF NEW TOOLS AND TESTING ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS THE CLOUD, SOFTWARE TESTING TOOLS, MOBILE ENVIRONMENT, AND APPLICATION PERFORMANCE. DIGITAL ASSURANCE IS MORE THAN THE TRADITIONAL QA; THE EVOLUTION OF AGILE METHODS WITH DEVOPS TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR SOFTWARE/SIMULATOR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING HAS MADE ITS DEPLOYMENT QUICK, SAFE AND RELIABLE. THE END-TO-END TESTING PROCESS SERVES TO SIMULATE THE REAL USER ON-FIELD SCENARIOS AND VALIDATE THE SYSTEM UNDER TEST AND ITS COMPONENTS FOR INTEGRATION AND DATA INTEGRITY. LEVERAGING DIGITAL 2.0 TRANSFORMATIONS, SMART OILFIELDS (BY IMPLEMENTING AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS) CAN ELIMINATE HUMAN INTERVENTION IN POTENTIAL RISK AREAS AND THEREBY PROVIDING A SAFE, COMPLIANT WORKPLACE FOR ENGINEERS, MANAGERS, CREWMEMBERS AND OTHER PERSONNEL. ESPECIALLY, ROBOTICS HAS POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE, AND SAFETY OPERATIONS. IN ALIGNMENT WITH THIS, OUR PERSONALIZED ROBOTIC TESTING SOLUTION CAN AUTOMATE VARIOUS PERIPHERAL DEVICES AND HAS RESULTED IN REDUCED TESTING CYCLE TIME UP TO 30% AND COST BY 40%. THE SOLUTION ENABLES AUTOMATED END-TO-END IOT DEVICE INTERACTIONS SPANNING SMART DEVICES SUCH AS CAMERA, THERMOSTAT, SENSORS AND WEB APPLICATIONS IN OIL AND GAS FACILITIES. ADDING, OUR VARIOUS OTHER IN-HOUSE DIGITAL FRAMEWORK AND SOLUTIONS SUCH AS BIG DATA VALIDATION FRAMEWORK, CLOUD-BASED ON-DEMAND TESTING, AND AUTOMATED TEST SCRIPTWRITERS HAVE EASED DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONS. DIGITAL ASSURANCE BY RIGOROUS TESTING PRACTICES CAN ALSO IMMUNE OIL AND GAS MAJORS FROM THE CYBER THREATS FOR THE CLOUD (GRID, STORAGE) AND BLOCKCHAIN. TO OVERCOME SUCH COMPROMISES IN HARDWARE FAILURE, OUR SMART AND INNOVATIVE IOT TEST WORKBENCH SOLUTION FOR INTEGRATION TESTING CAN REDUCE THE HARDWARE DEPENDENCY UP TO 100%. THIS NOVEL SOLUTION VIRTUALIZES RAPID IOT SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT REPLACING SMART DEVICES DURING TESTING UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS SUCH AS HPHT WELLS AND PERMAFROST CONDITIONS IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. FURTHERMORE, DIGITAL ASSURANCE COMPLIANCE COUPLED WITH DIGITALIZATION KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE CAN PLAY A PARAMOUNT ROLE IN AVERTING DISASTERS SUCH AS GOM DEEPWATER EXPLOSION AND MONTARA OIL SPILL IN THE FUTURE.

THERE ARE MINING, METALLURGICAL, PETROCHEMICAL, TIMBER, WOODWORKING AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. SUCH A DEVELOPED INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY PROVIDES STABLE NEEDS FOR QUALIFIED SPECIALISTS-ENGINEERS, TECHNOLOGISTS, POWER ENGINEERING SPECIALISTS. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SYSTEM OF HIGHER AND SECONDARY VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IS AIMED AT TRAINING PERSONNEL WHO ARE READY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVELY. THE WORLD NOWADAYS LIVES IN THE REALITIES OF THE ECONOMY, WHERE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED IN BOTH INDUSTRY AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE IN THE WORLD THAT THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO INCREASE LABOR PRODUCTIVITY. THE ECONOMY OF ANY COUNTRY EXPECTS THE REDUCTION OF COSTS, THE GROWTH OF EFFICIENCY, THE QUALITY OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPETITIVENESS FROM DIGITALIZATION. INCREASINGLY, WE USE THE TERMS “BIG DATA”, NEUROTECHNOLOGY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, NEW PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES, INDUSTRIAL INTERNET, ROBOTICS, SENSOR TECHNOLOGY, WIRELESS COMMUNICATION, VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY IN OUR VOCABULARY. MOREOVER, IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SOIL SCIENCES, SPACE RESEARCH OR GOVERNMENTAL MANAGEMENT. RUSSIA IS AIMED AT THE EMERGENCE OF HIGH-TECH ENTERPRISES OPERATING IN THE GLOBAL MARKET AND FORMING A SYSTEM OF START-UPS AND RESEARCH TEAMS THAT WILL ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY IN THE FUTURE. SIBERIAN FEDERAL UNIVERSITY AS ONE OF THE LARGEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY SEES ITS MISSION IN THE TRAINING OF SPECIALISTS WITH DIGITAL COMPETENCIES. UNDERSTANDING THE STRATEGY OF THE STATE, OUR UNIVERSITY ACTS AS A SOURCE OF EXPERTISE, ANALYTICAL JUDGMENTS, SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSIONS, WIDE DISSEMINATION AND USE OF INFORMATION, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. WE HAVE CREATED A TEAM OF LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE FROM AMONG THE UNIVERSITY FACULTY MEMBERS, REPRESENTATIVES OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY, WHO ARE READY FOR CHANGE. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO PRESENT THE AUTHORS’ EXPERIENCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT IN THE FORM OF THE CONCEPT OF A NEW MASTER’S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR THE TRAINING OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELD OF APPLIED INFORMATICS, READY FOR DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND ADAPTATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES OF VARIOUS INDUSTRY DIRECTIONS. THE GOAL IS ACHIEVED ON THE BASIS OF COMPETENCE AND SYSTEM APPROACHES. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON THE USE OF ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, COMPARISON, GENERALIZATION, INCLUDING PHENOMENOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION, SURVEY, INCLUDED OBSERVATION, AGILE-METHODOLOGY. THE RESULT OF THE TEAM’S ACTIVITY IN THE FORM OF THE DEVELOPED CONCEPT WILL HAVE A STRONG MOTIVATIONAL EFFECT BOTH ON THE LABOR MARKET AND ON THE UNIVERSITY APPLICANTS.

IT INVOLVES PROBLEM SOLVING, DOMAIN UNDERSTANDING AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS AS WELL AS KNOWLEDGE OF A BROAD VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGIES, ARCHITECTURES, AND SOLUTION APPROACHES. AS SUCH, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS INCLUDE MANY SITUATIONS WHERE CRUCIAL DECISIONS MUST BE MADE. MAKING THE APPROPRIATE ORGANIZATIONAL OR TECHNICAL CHOICES FOR A GIVEN SOFTWARE TEAM BUILDING A PRODUCT CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROJECT SUCCESS OR FAILURE. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODS HAVE INTRODUCED FRAMEWORKS AND SETS OF BEST PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN CONTEXTS, PROVIDING PRACTITIONERS WITH ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES FOR THESE IMPORTANT CHOICES. CURRENT AGILE METHODS EMPLOYED IN MODERN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HUMAN FACTORS IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THESE METHODS RELY ON SHORT FEEDBACK LOOPS AND THE SELF-ORGANIZATION OF TEAMS TO ENABLE COLLABORATIVE DECISION MAKING. WHILE AGILE METHODS STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF EMPIRICAL PROCESS CONTROL, I.E. RELYING ON DATA TO MAKE DECISIONS, THEY DO NOT PRESCRIBE IN DETAIL HOW THIS GOAL SHOULD BE ACHIEVED. IN THIS PAPER, WE DESCRIBE THE TYPES AND ABSTRACTION LEVELS OF DATA AND DECISIONS WITHIN MODERN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAMS AND IDENTIFY THE BENEFITS THAT USAGE OF THIS DATA ENABLES. WE ARGUE THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING ARE HIGHLY APPLICABLE, YET UNDERUSED, IN MODERN AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.

CURRENTLY, ONTOLOGY IS USED IN SEMANTIC WEB, INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, ETC. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONTOLOGY INVOLVES A STRUCTURAL AND LOGICAL COMPLEXITY THAT IS COMPARABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE ARTIFACTS. THEREFORE, ONTOLOGY BUILDING REQUIRES A METHODOLOGY TO ENSURE ITS RELIABILITY. IN THIS CONTEXT, THERE ARE SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES PROPOSED FOR BUILDING ONTOLOGIES. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE EXISTING METHODOLOGIES FAILED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT DETAILS FOR THE ACTIVITIES AND TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED IN THEM WITH A DEFINED ONTOLOGY LIFECYCLE. TO BUILD ONTOLOGIES THAT ARE RELIABLE, LONG LIVED AND CONTINUALLY ADAPTED, THE ONTOLOGY ENGINEERING (OE) SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (OE). BUT, SE WAS NOT INITIALLY MEANT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE ARTIFACTS SUCH AS ONTOLOGIES. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP BETWEEN THEM IN TERMS OF POPULARITY AND MATURITY LEVEL. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO BRIDGE THIS GAP BY PROPOSING AN AGILE METHODOLOGY FOR ONTOLOGY DEVELOPMENT (AMOD). AMOD ADOPTS THE AGILE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES IN THE ONTOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. THE FINAL FRAMEWORK OF AMOD FITS THE VARIOUS ONTOLOGY ACTIVITIES INTO THE PHASES OF THE SCRUM AGILE METHODOLOGY. IT HAS THREE PHASES: PRE-GAME, DEVELOPMENT AND POST-GAME. AMOD WAS APPLIED TO DEVELOP ONTOLOGY FOR SOFTWARE PROJECT TIME MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, A COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT ONTOLOGY METHODOLOGIES WITH RESPECT TO THE IEEE STANDARD WAS MADE. RESULTS SHOWED THAT AMOD RESULTED IN 56% SATISFACTION FOR IEEE STANDARD PROCESSES. THIS RESEMBLES 22% ENHANCEMENT IN THE SATISFACTION AGAINST THE OTHER METHODOLOGIES. © 2019, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT ENGINEERING AND SYSTEMS.";"KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING; ONTOLOGY; ONTOLOGY DEVELOPMENT; ONTOLOGY ENGINEERING; ONTOLOGY METHODOLOGIES; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"GRUBER, T., TOWARD PRINCIPLES FOR THE DESIGN OF ONTOLOGIES USED FOR KNOWLEDGE SHARING (1995) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES, 43, PP. 907-928; ABDELGHANY, A., DARWISH, N., HEFNY, H., TOWARDS A HYBRID APPROACH FOR SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT USING ONTOLOGY ALIGNMENT (2017) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS, 168 (6); KHATTAK, A., BATOOL, R., PERVEZ, Z., ONTOLOGY EVOLUTION AND CHALLENGES (2013) JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, 29, PP. 851-871; SUÁREZ-FIGUEROA, M., GARCÍA-CASTRO, R., VILLAZÓN-TERRAZAS, B., GÓMEZ-PÉREZ, A., ESSENTIALS IN ONTOLOGY ENGINEERING: METHODOLOGIES, LANGUAGES, AND TOOLS (2011) IN: PROC.

AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS ONE OF THEM. AGILE IS A TIME-DEPENDENT APPROACH TO SOFTWARE DELIVERY. SCRUM IS THE AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY PROCESS THAT IS EXTENSIVELY UTILIZED TODAY IN MANY OF THE SOFTWARE COMPANIES. IT IS AN AGILE TECHNIQUE TO HANDLE A PROJECT, USUALLY IN AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT BY WAY OF SCRUM IS FREQUENTLY PERCEIVED AS A METHODOLOGY; HOWEVER THAN SHOWING SCRUM AS METHODOLOGY, CONSIDER OF IT AS A FRAMEWORK FOR HANDLING A PROCESS. THIS PAPER WILL INITIATE WITH THE BACKGROUND, IT WILL COVER THE CHARACTERISTICS AND DEFINITION OF AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND HIGHLIGHTS THE MAJOR DIFFERENT AGILE SOFTWARE TECHNIQUES.

THIS OBJECTIVE REQUIRES THE USE OF METHODOLOGIES THAT IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES, INNOVATION AND MOTIVATION OF ITS STAFF. THE APPLICATION OF AGILE METHODS ADOPT A SET OF PRINCIPLES WITH THE AIM OF GENERATING PROFITS AS ADAPTATION, PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE, AND THEREFORE IMPROVED COMPETITIVENESS. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A MODEL FOR MEASURING AND IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY APPLICABLE TO ECUADORIAN SOFTWARE COMPANIES.

AMONG THE MOST POPULAR IS THE FRAMEWORK OF SCRUM (1986), WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY ITERATIONS, WHERE IN EACH ITERATION IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE A PLANNING, ANALYSIS OF REQUIREMENTS, DESIGN, CODING, TESTS AND DOCUMENTATION. THE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION IN SCRUM IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF USER STORIES (US), WHICH ARE THE DESCRIPTION OF A REQUIREMENT WRITTEN IN ONE OR TWO SENTENCES USING THE USER'S NATURAL LANGUAGE. AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF US IS THAT THEY MUST BE ESTIMABLE, THAT IS TO SAY, IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE TIME IT WILL TAKE TO COMPLETE IT. THIS ALLOWS THE SCRUM DEVELOPMENT TEAM TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL TIME OF THE PROJECT. HOWEVER IN PRACTICE, THIS TASK STILL HAS PROBLEMS DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND AFFECTS THE AGREEMENT OF US IN EACH ITERATION. IN THIS PAPER WE PROPOSE A STRATEGY TO CLASSIFY THE US FOLLOWING THE TAXONOMY OF BLOOM TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF ITS COMPLEXITY AND BY DOING SO MAKE AN AGILE ESTIMATION OF THE APPROXIMATE TIME THAT EACH ONE REQUIRES FOR ITS REALIZATION.

MOST OF THESE DEVICES WILL COMMUNICATE WIRELESSLY IN A LIMITED SPECTRUM WHICH MEANS THAT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INTERFERENCES WILL BE GENERATED. TO OVERCOME THESE INTERFERENCES, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN (BATTERY) POWER CONSUMPTION IS NEEDED TO RE-TRANSMIT PACKAGES AND TO PROVIDE A TRANSMIT POWER MARGIN. HENCE, THIS CHALLENGE CALLS FOR AGILE METHODS THAT CAN OVERCOME THE INTERFERENCES WITHOUT WASTING POWER. IN THIS PAPER, THE PROBLEM IS ADDRESSED BY USING A SELF-ADAPTING MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM WHICH USES INFORMATION FROM THE CHANNEL STATE TO PREDICT THE TRANSMIT POWER LEVEL THAT IS NEEDED TO OVERCOME THE INTERFERENCES. THIS APPROACH PREDICTS THE CORRECT TRANSMIT POWER LEVEL WHEN A PACKAGE NEEDS TO BE SENT AND THEREBY AVOIDS WASTING POWER ON SELECTING A WRONG TRANSMIT POWER LEVEL, I.E., EITHER EXCESS POWER IS WASTED OR EXTRA POWER IS WASTED TO RETRANSMIT THE PACKET.

CUSTOMERS ARE RELYING ON THE FUNCTIONALITY AND ACCURACY THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE SOFTWARE. THE LAST DECADES OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, FOCUSED ON SEQUENTIAL AND PHASED MODELS LIKE THE WATERFALL MODEL, SPIRAL MODEL, ETC, TODAY THE FOCUS IS ON ITERATIVE AND INCREMENTAL METHODS IN FORM OF AGILE METHODS. WORLD'S CMM LEVEL 5 COMPANIES ARE ALSO USING AGILE METHODS TO GIVE A NEW EDGE TO THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ILLUSTRATE A TWO WAY ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUE THAT CAN BE ADOPTED TO INFUSE A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN THE SOFTWARE TESTING LIFECYCLE. THE TWO WAY ASSESSMENT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION TWO THINGS: THE PERSPECTIVE OF MANAGEMENT/ DEVELOPERS IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS TESTING ATTRIBUTES ANDWORKING ON EACH OF THE ATTRIBUTE. THUS THE \"TWO-FOLD APPROACH\" DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER IS AN ATTEMPT TO GO BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL METHODOLOGY OF MEASURING SYSTEM EFFECTIVENESS.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES AN ORIGAMI ACTIVE LEARNING EXERCISE TO TEACH THE PRINCIPLES OF SCRUM IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS COURSES. THE EXERCISE SHOWS STUDENTS HOW AGILE METHODS RESPOND TO CHANGES IN REQUIREMENTS DURING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, ONE OF THE FOUR AGILE PRINCIPLES, IN A DEEPER MANNER THAN MANY AGILE ACTIVE LEARNING EXERCISES. THIS LEARNING ACTIVITY USES AN UNCOMMON APPROACH IN AGILE EXERCISES IN THAT TASKS ARE PROVIDED, ESTIMATES MADE, PROGRESS IS MEASURED, AND PIVOTS TO NEW TASKS CAN BE INTRODUCED BASED ON TASK PROGRESS. ALL STUDENTS WERE INTRODUCED TO SCRUM THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT LESSONS - ONE LECTURE-FOCUSED AND ONE ACTIVITY-FOCUSED. STUDENTS WERE SURVEYED AFTER EACH LESSON TO DETERMINE LESSON EFFECTIVENESS. STUDENTS INDICATED THEY UNDERSTOOD AGILE CONCEPTS AFTER COMPLETING THE EXERCISE AND FOUND THE ACTIVITY ENGAGING. STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF AGILE WERE SIMILAR FOR BOTH LECTURE AND ACTIVITY LESSONS. THE RESULTS FROM THE STUDY FIND THAT STUDENTS' PERCEPTION OF AGILE LEARNING INCREASED WHEN THEY HAD THE LECTURE FOLLOWED BY THE ACTIVITY. IF CLASS TIME IS CONSTRAINED TO A SINGLE LESSON THEN THE ACTIVITY WOULD BE MORE BENEFICIAL THAN THE LECTURE.

WE PROPOSE THE ACO TO ASSUME A BEHAVIOR MAINLY SUPPORTIVE, DUE TO THE EMPOWERMENT THAT EVERY AGILE DEVELOPMENT TEAM MUST HAVE BY DEFINITION. IN ADDITION, THE ARCHITECTURE OF THIS ACO AIMS TO COVER THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT, FROM PROJECT AND PROGRAM UP TO THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT. THIS DIVISION ALSO REDUCES THE COMPLEXITY OF ACO'S IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND GIVES FLEXIBILITY TO REARRANGE THE ACO OVER TIME. © 2018 THE AUTHORS.

THUS, THE UPGRADED VERSION OF THE V-MODEL TESTING IS SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITH THE WEAKNESSES OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION IN QUESTION BY COMBINING IT WITH THE METHOD KNOWN AS AGILE TESTING. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORT, HYPOTHESIS SUCH AS THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE EXISTING V-MODEL TESTING VIA LITERATURE REVIEW AND INTERVIEWS WITH RESPECTIVE SPECIALISTS IN THE SPHERE WERE ANALYSED. SUCCESSIVELY, THE POSSIBLE ADVANTAGES OF AGILE METHOD OF TESTING WERE THEN CONSIDERED. MOREOVER, THE REPORT COMES UP WITH THE WAYS IN WHICH THE TWO MODELS COULD BE NATURALLY COMBINED TO PRODUCE A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE ONE. ONCE THE NEW MODEL WAS PRESENTED, ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES WERE ASSESSED BY THE MEANS OF A CASE STUDY ANALYSIS USING METRIC AND A DATA ANALYSIS THROUGH A SURVEY WERE CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE FUTURIST MODEL. PROMPTLY, THE RESEARCH FOUND THAT THE SUGGESTED TESTING MODEL PROVIDES BETTER RESULTS THAN THE COMMON VERSION OF V-MODEL TESTING. FIRSTLY, A REAL CASE SCENARIOS UNDER METRIC EVALUATION OF THE MODELS HAVE INDICATED THAT THE PROPOSED MODEL IS BETTER THAN THE V-MODEL, SINCE IT CAN HANDLE THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS; REDUCED TESTING TIME, DEBUGGING, PRIORITIZATION OF REQUIREMENTS, EASY MAPPING OF ROLES AND IMPROVED VISIBILITY OF PROJECT RESOURCES. SECONDLY, A SURVEY DATA ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTED VARIOUS ADVANTAGES OF THE FUTURE MODEL. THE TOP PRIORITIES OF THE NEW MODEL FROM THE RESPONDENT'S PERCEPTION WERE; THE NEW MODEL MANAGES RAPIDLY CHANGING PRIORITIES, IT ACCELERATES TIME TO MARKET, IT INCREASES PRODUCTIVITY AND IT IMPROVES QUALITY. © 2018 THE AUTHORS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PRACTICES AND CHALLENGES WHEN DEVELOPING ACADEMIC SOFTWARE ENGINEERING MOOCS. TO THIS END, WE RESEARCH (I) HOW MOOCS IN SEE ARE DESIGNED AND (II) WHAT LEARNING DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS EDUCATORS AND LEARNING DESIGNERS HAVE WHEN DEVELOPING SEE-RELATED MOOCS. TO ADDRESS THE FIRST RESEARCH QUESTION, A SYSTEMATIC MAPPING IS PERFORMED TO OUTLINE THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE. THE SECOND RESEARCH QUESTION IS ANSWERED BY ANALYZING AND REFLECTING ON PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES ACQUIRED DURING THE DESIGN OF A MOOC ON AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THE DESIGN OF THE COURSE WAS BASED ON THE PEDAGOGICAL DESIGN PATTERN FRAMEWORK FOR MOOCS, AN APPROACH TO DESIGN FOR LEARNING THAT WAS DEFINED IN OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES. FOR THIS COURSE, TWO ENVIRONMENTS WERE CONSIDERED: (A) COURSE-TIME ON THE TIM TEC MOOC PLATFORM FOR DEEPER ENGAGEMENT WITH ACTIVE LEARNING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS PROJECT-BASED LEARNING; (B) A FACEBOOK GROUP AS A SOCIAL AND COLLABORATIVE LEARNING SPACE, INCLUDING SCENARIOS BASED ON PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING TO ACTIVATE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. SOME OF THE PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGIES ADOPTED TO MOTIVATE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING INCLUDED SELF-INTRODUCTION VIDEO, DIARY, DIAGNOSTIC SELF-ASSESSMENTS, DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL PROJECTS ALONE AND IN PAIRS. OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL TECHNOLOGICAL AND PEDAGOGICAL CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO AS TO ENHANCE THE MOOCS LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR SEE. TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS AND EDUCATIONAL GAMES, WHICH SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO MOOCS, AND THE USE OF LEARNING ANALYTICS TO SUPPORT MOTIVATION, USER EXPERIENCE, AND MORE ACTIVE LEARNING IN SPECIFIC TOPICS, SUCH AS PROJECT MANAGEMENT, AGILE METHODS, AND REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING. IN TURN, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND NEEDED IMPROVEMENT TO THE PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS IS A RE-THINKING OF THE VIRTUAL MOMENT IN THE MOOC PLATFORM SO AS TO OPTIMIZE IT THROUGH ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE ACTIVE LEARNING AND CONTEXTUALIZED ASSESSMENTS. © 2017 IEEE.";"AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; DESIGN PATTERNS; LEARNING DESIGN; LIFELONG LEARNING; MOOCS; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; CURRICULA; E-LEARNING; PROJECT MANAGEMENT; SOFTWARE DESIGN; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING; TEACHING; AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; DESIGN PATTERNS; LEARNING DESIGNS; LIFE LONG LEARNING; MOOCS; ENGINEERING EDUCATION";"";"";"";"";"CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO, CNPQ";"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL TO THE BRAZILIAN FUNDING AGENCIES (CNPQ, CAPES, FAPEMIG, FAPESP) AND THE IFSULDEMINAS FOR THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

HENCE, IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRIES SHOULD HAVE PROPER PLANNING FOR ESTIMATING THE EFFORT REQUIRED IN AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THE EXISTING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS EXPERT OPINION, ANALOGY AND DISAGGREGATION ARE MOSTLY OBSERVED TO BE AD HOC AND IN THIS MANNER INCLINED TO BE MISTAKEN IN A NUMBER OF CASES. ONE OF THE VARIOUS APPROACHES FOR CALCULATING EFFORT OF AGILE PROJECTS IN AN EMPIRICAL WAY IS THE STORY POINT APPROACH (SPA). THIS PAPER PRESENTS A STUDY ON ANALYSIS OF PREDICTION ACCURACY OF ESTIMATION PROCESS EXECUTED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE IT USING SPA. DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS DECISION TREE, STOCHASTIC GRADIENT BOOSTING AND RANDOM FOREST ARE CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO ASSESS PREDICTION MORE QUALITATIVELY.

THIS IS DUE TO THE NATURE OF FIRST YEAR STUDENTS CHARACTERIZED BY UNDER-PREPAREDNESS, POOR ACADEMIC BACKGROUND AND SO ON. MOREOVER, THE TRADITIONAL LECTURE-BASED APPROACH IS USED AND THE COMPUTER LABORATORIES ARE RARELY USED. CONSEQUENTLY, STUDENTS ARE NOT MOTIVATED, ENGAGED OR NO ACTIVE PARTICIPATION. WHILE THIS TEACHING APPROACH HAS FAILED TO ACHIEVE LEARNING OUTCOME, INCORPORATING CUTTING-EDGE PRACTICES LIKE AGILE METHODS INTO THE TEACHING COULD BE VALUABLE. THIS STEMS FROM THE WIDESPREAD IN PRACTICE AND ACCEPTANCE OF AGILE METHODS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRIES TODAY. THOUGH AGILE PRACTICES LIKE PAIR PROGRAMMING HAVE IMPACTED STUDENTS' PROGRAMMING PROJECTS, NONE HAS BEEN REPORTED ON TEACHING. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NEW APPROACH OF TEACHING CP USING THE AGILE METHODS. THE GOAL IS TO ASSIST BEGINNERS ACQUIRE NEEDED PROGRAMMING SKILLS, PROFFER TEACHING TECHNIQUE THAT MAXIMIZES THE CHANCES OF ENGAGEMENT, ACTIVE PARTICIPATION, AND IMPROVING TEACHING BY REFLECTING ON WHAT HAS BEEN TAUGHT AND WHAT THE STUDENTS ARE LEARNING. ADDITIONALLY, BEGINNERS WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE COMPUTER, WRITE CORRECT CODE, GAIN BETTER PROGRAMMING SKILLS AND ASSIST TEACHERS TO MANAGE LARGE CLASSES EFFECTIVELY. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE STUDY ADOPTED THE FRAMEWORK FOR DECODING THE DISCIPLINE. © 2015 IEEE.";"AGILE PROCESS; COMPUTER PROGRAMMING; LEARNING; TEACHING; UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS";"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; EDUCATION; EDUCATION COMPUTING; STUDENTS; TEACHING; AGILE PROCESS; COMPUTER LABORATORY; COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION; LEARNING; PROGRAMMING PROJECTS; TEACHING AND LEARNING; TEACHING TECHNIQUES; UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS; COMPUTER PROGRAMMING";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"NORTHEDGE, A., (2003) RETHINKING TEACHING IN THE CONTEXT OF DIVERSITY TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION, 8 (1); BIGGS, J., WHAT THE STUDENT DOES: TEACHING FOR ENHANCED LEARNING (1999) HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT, 18 (1), PP. 57-75; JONES, G., KNEZEK, G., NON-COMMERCIAL RADIO-SATELLITE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: AFFORDABLE OPTIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY EDUCATORS.

TEACHING AND LEARNING AT UNIVERSITY HAS SINCE MIGRATED FROM TRADITIONAL LEARNING TO ACTIVE LEARNING METHODOLOGY WHERE STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO LEARN BY DOING RATHER THAN LISTENING PASSIVELY TO LECTURES ALONE. THE AGILE METHODOLOGY NATURALLY HAS PROMOTED THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF TEAM MEMBERS DURING SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PHASES. SOME LITERATURE HAVE PROPOSED WAYS OF ADOPTING AGILE INTO ACTIVE LEARNING TO IMPROVE TEACHING AND LEARNING PROCESSES AND HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THIS METHOD AS A GREAT SUCCESS. WE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT HOW EFFICIENT THE AGILE CONCEPT IS IN TACKLING SEVERAL SITUATIONS IN ACADEMIC LEARNING AS SHOWN BY AN INTERESTING MAPPING OF AGILE PRINCIPLES TO THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO OFFER OPTIONS FOR THE AGILE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK TO CONSIDER ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT AS A TOOL TO OBTAIN THE AGILE PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK. © 2016 BY IGI GLOBAL.

IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A GRAMMAR FOR STORIES OF INTERACTION CALLED USERX STORY, IN ORDER TO REMEDY THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY TEAMS TO INSERT UX ASPECTS AND USABILITY REQUIREMENTS IN THE FIRST STEPS OF SOFTWARE CONCEPTION. AN ACTION RESEARCH APPROACH WAS APPLIED TO CARRY OUT THE RESEARCH WITHIN THE INDUSTRY, ALLOWING US TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AGILE TEAMS. THE RESEARCH CYCLE WAS SPLIT IN THREE STEPS. IN THE FIRST STEP, WE CARRIED OUT A TECHNICAL LITERATURE SURVEY, AIMING TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF USER STORIES IN THE AGILE METHODOLOGIES, AND ADDITIONALLY, AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY ALSO WAS CARRIED OUT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE TRADITIONAL USER STORIES WERE BEING DEVELOPED BY PRODUCT OWNERS. IN THE SECOND STEP, WE PROPOSED TOGETHER WITH BOTH TEAMS - UX AND AGILE - A GRAMMAR TO USERX STORY INCORPORATING TWO CONCEPTS OF UX: PERSONAS AND NIELSEN’S HEURISTICS. IN THE THIRD STEP, SIX PRODUCT OWNERS WERE INVITED TO IMPLEMENT THE USERX STORIES IN REAL PROJECTS. AFTER THAT, WE INTERVIEWED THE PARTICIPANTS AIMING TO COLLECT THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF USERX STORIES. THUS, WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT MOST OF THE AGILE TEAMS APPROVED THE USE OF THE STORIES INCORPORATING UX ASPECTS. © SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND 2016.";"AGILE; SCRUM; USABILITY; USER EXPERIENCE; USER STORY";"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; COMPUTER SCIENCE; COMPUTERS; AGILE; SCRUM; USABILITY; USER EXPERIENCE; USER STORIES; HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"BARKSDALE, J., RAGAN, E., MCCRICKARD, D., (2009) EASING TEAM USABILITY: A CONCEPT MAPPING APPROACH, , AGILE CONFERENCE.

SUCH GROUP OF METHODOLOGIES IS CALLED “AGILE.” THESE METHODOLOGIES MOSTLY FOCUS ON HOW TO MAXIMIZE FLEXIBILITY AND MINIMIZE TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THESE METHODOLOGIES ARE NOT ONLY BASED ON THEORY, BUT ALSO RATHER DERIVED FROM EXPERIENCES OF SUCCESSFUL PROJECT TEAMS. BASED ON THE CURRENT TREND IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, SOFTWARE DEVELOPING COMPANIES ARE CHOOSING AGILE METHODOLOGIES IN WHICH SCRUM IS WIDELY USED. IN THIS WORK, THE ADOPTION PROCESS OF SCRUM BY A SOFTWARE COMPANY IS DISCUSSED. © SPRINGER INDIA 2016.";"ADOPTION; AGILE; ENTERPRISE CULTURE; SCRUM";"AGILE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; COMPUTER SOFTWARE SELECTION AND EVALUATION; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING; ADOPTION; AGILE; AGILE METHODOLOGIES; CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS; ENTERPRISE CULTURE; SCRUM; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES; SOFTWARE INDUSTRY; SOFTWARE DESIGN";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"REDDAIAH, B., RAVI, S.P., MOVVA, L.S., RISK MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IN SCRUM (2013) INT J COMPUT APPL, 65, PP. 16-23; RAVI, S.P., REDDAIAH, B., MOVVA, L.S., KILAPARTHI, R., A CRITICAL REVIEW AND EMPIRICAL STUDY ON SUCCESS OF RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY WITH RESPECT TO SCRUM (2012) ENG SCI TECHNOL: INT J, 2, PP. 467-473; SCHWABER, K., (2004) AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT WITH SCRUM, , REDMOND: MICROSOFT PRESS; SCHWABER, K., BEEDLE, M., (2002) AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT WITH SCRUM, , PRENTICE HALL; POPPENDIECK, M., A HISTORY OF LEAN: FORM MANUFACTURING TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (2005) JAOO CONFERENCE, , AATHUS, DENMARH; LIKER, J.K., (2004) THE TOYOTA WAY: 14 MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES FROM THE WORLD’S GREATEST MANUFACTURER, , NEW YORK: MCGRAW-HILL; HOLFORD, W.D., EBRAHIMI, M., HONDA: APPROACH TO INNOVATION IN AEROSPACE AND AUTOMOTIVE/PICK-UP TRUCK DEVELOPMENT: A DIALECTICAL YET COHERENT FIRM (2007) 40TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES (HICSS-40) BIG ISLAND HAWAII; TEKEUCHI, H., NONAKA, I., (2004) HITOTSUBASHI ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENNT, , SINGAPORE: WILEY; SENGE, P.M., (1990) THE FIFTH DISCIPLINE: THE ART AND PRACTICE OF THE LEARNING ORGANIZATION, , CURRENCY NEW YORK";"REDDAIAH, B.; DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, INDIA; EMAIL: B.REDDAIAH@YOGIVEMANAUNIVERSITY.AC.IN";"PANIGRAHI B.K.BHASKAR M.A.DAS S.DASH S.S.";"";"SPRINGER VERLAG";"INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATIONS IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS, ICAIECES 2015";"22 APRIL 2015 THROUGH 23 APRIL 2015";"";"164469";"21945357";"9788132226543";"";"";"ENGLISH";"ADV.

A LIMITED NUMBER OF RESEARCH WORKS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THIS AREA. THE EXISTING PROCESS TAILORING APPROACHES DESCRIBE SIMILAR SET OF OPERATIONS AND DO NOT PROVIDE PROPER GUIDELINES ON PERFORMING PROCESS TAILORING. THESE TAILORING APPROACHES MAINLY FOCUS ON LARGE COMPANIES AND TAILOR ONLY ONE OR TWO AGILE METHODS INSTEAD OF PROVIDING SPECIFIC GUIDELINES ON TAILORING AGILE BASED METHODOLOGIES. UNLIKE LARGE COMPANIES, ATTENTION HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN TO SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES. THE PRESENT STUDY ADDRESSES THIS LIMITATION, IDENTIFIES PROCESS TAILORING OPERATIONS, KEY PROCESSES OF AGILE BASED METHODOLOGIES AND USES THEM FOR TAILORING PROCESSES FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES. QUALITATIVE RESEARCH METHODS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY AND VALIDATE TAILORING OPERATIONS AND KEY PROCESSES OF AGILE BASED METHODOLOGIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT PERFORMING THESE TAILORING OPERATIONS TO TAILOR KEY AGILE BASED PROCESSES IS AN EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABLE PROCESS TAILORING APPROACH FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES. THE OUTCOME OF THE PRESENT STUDY WOULD PROVIDE BASIS FOR FORMULATING PROCESS TAILORING FRAMEWORK FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES. © 2014 IEEE.";"AGILE; CLIENT; PROCESS TAILORING; PROCESSES";"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; COMPUTER SCIENCE; COMPUTERS; ENGINEERING; INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING; PROCESSING; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING; AGILE; AGILE METHODS; CLIENT; LARGE COMPANIES; PROCESS TAILORING; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH METHODS; SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS; SOFTWARE DESIGN";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"YOON, I.-C., TAILORING AND VERIFYING SOFTWARE PROCESS (2001) PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH ASIA-PACIFIC SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, PP. 202-209; DAI, F., LI, T., TAILORING SOFTWARE EVOLUTION PROCESS (2007) 8TH ACIS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE, NETWORKING AND PARALLEL/DISTRIBUTING COMPUTING, PP. 782-787; XU, P., RAMESH, B., USING PROCESS TAILORING TO MANAGE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES (2008) IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY ITPRO; NERUR, S., CHALLENGES OF MIGRATING TO AGILE METHODOLOGIES (2005) COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM, 48, PP. 73-78; (2001) SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INSTITUE, , HTTP//WWW.SEI.CMU.EDU/CMMI/, CMMI DEVELOPMENT TEAM, CAPABILITY MATURITY MODEL-INTEGRATED VERSION 1. 1; (2000) INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION, ISO STANDARD 9001: QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; HARRY, M.J., SCHROEDER, R., (2006) SIX SIGMA: THE BREAKTHROUGH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY REVOLUTIONIZING THE WORLD'S TOP CORPORATIONS, , CROWN PUBLISHING GROUP; POPPENDIECK, M., POPPENDIECK, T., (2003) LEAN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AN AGILE TOOLKIT, , ADDISON-WESLEY; HIGHSMITH, J., COCKBURN, A., AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: THE BUSINESS OF INNOVATION (2001) IEEE COMPUTER, 34, PP. 120-127; BOEHM, B., GET READY FOR AGILE METHODS, WITH CARE (2002) COMPUTER, 35, PP. 64-69; (2001) PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE AGILE MANIFESTO AGILE ALLIANCE, , HTTP//AGILEMANIFESTO.ORG/PRINCIPLES.HTML; FERREIRA, C., COHEN, J., AGILE SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND STAKEHOLDER SATISFACTION: A SOUTH AFRICAN EMPIRICAL STUDY (2008) PROCEEDINGS OF SAICSIT'08, PP. 48-55; PEDREIRA, O., A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF SOFTWARE PROCESS TAILORING (2007) ACM SIGSOFT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING NOTES, 32; HOSSAIN, E., TOWARDS AN UNDERSTANDING OF TAILORING SCRUM IN GLOBAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: A MULTI-CASE STUDY (2011) 2011 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM PROCESS, PP. 110-119; WELZEL, D., TAILORING AND CONFORMANCE TESTING OF SOFTWARE PROCESSES: THE PROCEPT APPROACH (1995) THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND IEEE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING STANDARDS SYMPOSIUM; XU, P., RAMESH, B., A TOOL FOR THE CAPTURE AND USE OF PROCESS KNOWLEDGE IN PROCESS TAILORING (2003) PROCEEDINGS OF THE 36TH HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES (HICSS'03); SEAMAN, C.B., QUALITATIVE METHODS IN EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (1999) IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, 25, PP. 557-572. , JULY/AUGUST; RUNESON, P., HOST, M., GUIDELINE FOR CONDUCTING AND REPORTING CASE STUDY RESEARCH IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (2009) EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, 14, PP. 131-164; MIRAKHORLI, M., RDP TECHNIQUE: A PRACTICE TO CUSTOMIZE XP (2008) APSO'08, , LEIPZIG, GERMANY; GOPAL, A., THE ROLE OF SOFTWARE PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATION IN OFFSHORE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (2002) COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM, 45, PP. 193-199; NASIR, M.H.N., SAHIBUDDIN, S., CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR SOFTWARE PROJECTS: A COMAPRATIVE STUDY (2011) SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ESSAYS, 6, PP. 2174-2186. , 18 MAY; REEL, J.S., CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS IN SOFTWARE PROJECTS (1999) IEEE SOFTWARE, 16, PP. 18-23; RAMASUBBU, N., BALAN, R.K., TOWARDS GOVERNANCE SCHEMES FOR DISTRIBUTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (2008) SDG'08, , MAY 12,LEIPZIG, GERMANY,2008; AIKEN, J., TECHNICAL AND HUMAN PERSPECTIVE ON PAIR PROGRAMMING (2004) ACM SIGSOFT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING NOTES, 29 (5); TURK, D., LIMITATIONS OF AGILE SOFTWARE PROCESSES (2002) PROCEEDINGS OF 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EXTREME PROGRAMMING AND AGILE PROCESSES IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, , ACM, USA; FLICK, U., (2009) AN INTRODUCTION TO QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, , SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD.

THE MEDOV HELPS STAKEHOLDERS IN THEIR EVERYDAY WORK WITH MINIMAL IMPACT ON AGILITY. THE METHOD ALSO ENSURES AN ACTIVE ROLE OF BUSINESS USERS, A WIDE-PICTURE WHAT USUALLY IS THE PROBLEM FOR AGILE DEVELOPMENT, AND DEFINITION OF NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS, WHAT THE EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM IS. THE MEDOV ENSURES THAT NO UNNECESSARY FEATURES ARE PRODUCED SO THAT NO EXTRA CODE IS CREATED, AND MAINTENANCE IS EASIER, AS WELL AS CODE CORRECTION AND IMPROVEMENT.

DATA PROCESSING WAS, IS AND WILL BE AT THE CENTER OF INTEREST OF ALL FIRMS, ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. THE REASONS ARE NATURAL. THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION, AND ORIENTATION IS VERY DIFFICULT WITH REGARDS TO DATA VOLUME, VARIETY AND VELOCITY. THE SELECTION OF THE CORRECT WAY FOR OPTIMAL COMPUTATIONAL PROCESSING HAS A NUMBER OF FORMS VIA PREFERENCES BY ACTUAL CONDITIONS AND IT USER PREFERENCES. THE BETTER SOLUTIONS ARE DESIGNED WITH SUPPORT IN COOPERATION WITH THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. THE NEW APPROACHES AND IDEAS ARE OFTEN LINKED TO INNOVATIONS BASED ON INSPIRATION FROM SWARM INTELLIGENCE, TRUST IN AN AGILE METHOD, OR GRAPHIC SUPPORT WITHIN THE SIMULATION. ALL SUCH APPROACHES HELP IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMAL IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH SETTINGS AND CONFIGURATION, BUT MANY IT USERS HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THEIR REAL BENEFITS IN PRACTICE. THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH COMPLEXITY, ORIENTATION, OFFERED SERVICES, OR TIMELINES OF OBTAINED RESULTS AND ANALYSES. BASED ON THIS REALITY, THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT A BETTER METHOD FOR SIMULATION DESIGN FOR OPTIMAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT WITH REGARDS TO ACTUAL REALITY. THESE SIMULATIONS ARE SUCCESSFULLY USED IN SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION THROUGH NEEDED OBJECTS. STANDARD OBJECTS ARE USED FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ADOPTED RESOLUTION BASED ON OBJECT FEATURES SUCH AS NAME, SIZE, AND CAPACITY. FOR ACTUAL REALITY DESCRIPTION, THERE ARE OTHER FEATURES NEEDED WITH LINKS ON CURRENT CONTEXT. INSPIRATION OF THIS IDEA IS BASED ON PHEROMONES FROM SWARM INTELLIGENCE LIKE A POINT OF INTERACTION. THESE ADDITIONAL OBJECT FEATURES ARE ORIENTED ON PRACTICAL PREFERENCES SUCH AS STANDARD PROFESSIONAL MATTER, COOPERATION, PRESENTATION, MANAGEMENT, ANALYTICAL MATTER, CREATIVITY, MULTICULTURAL NEEDS, SERVICES, AND CONTACT WITH THE CUSTOMER. PRACTICAL PREFERENCES THEN DEFINE THE TOTAL PRIORITY OF AN OBJECT IN A SIMULATION. THE BENEFIT OF THE TOTAL PRIORITY OF AN OBJECT IS A BETTER RELATION TO ACTUAL REALITY, AND AN OPTIMAL DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING NEEDS BY PREFERENCES IN A DYNAMIC SOCIETY. THIS APPROACH OFFERS A BETTER WAY OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIKE OPERATING AND DATABASE SYSTEMS, OR BI (BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE) AND CRM (CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT) PRODUCTS.";"GLOBAL CHANGES; OBJECT FEATURES; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; SWARM INTELLIGENCE";"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; COMPUTER SOFTWARE; DATA HANDLING; DATABASE SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT SCIENCE; PUBLIC RELATIONS; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING; AMOUNT OF INFORMATION; COMPUTATIONAL PROCESSING; CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; GLOBAL CHANGE; INTERACTION FEATURES; OBJECT FEATURES; SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION; SWARM INTELLIGENCE; SOFTWARE DESIGN";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"ANNAN, K., (2000) WE THE PEOPLE, THE ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN THE 21ST CENTURY, , UNITED NATIONS; ABRAMSKY, S., PETRI NETS, DISCRETE PHYSICS, AND DISTRIBUTED QUANTUM COMPUTATION ONLINE, , HTTP://WWW.COMLAB.OX.AC.UK/FILES/381/FEST.PDF, OXFORD UNIVERSITY COMPUTING LABORATORY, CIT. 2012-12-14; BERGER, M., SOLER, J., BREWKA, L., YU, H., TSAGKAROPOULOS, M., LECLERC, Y., OLMA, C., METHODOLOGY AND TOOLSET FOR MODEL VERIFICATION, HARDWARE/SOFTWARE CO- SIMULATION, PERFORMANCE OPTIMISATION AND CUSTOMISABLE SOURCE-CODE GENERATION (2013) WSEAS TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS, 10, PP. 169-178; GLOBALIZATION AND CIVIL SOCIETY, BĚLOHOUBEK, I., (2006) GLOBALIZATION AND GLOBAL ISSUES, , UK IN PRAGUE, CENTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT; BLUM, C.H., MERKLE, D., (2008) SWARM INTELLIGENCE: INTRODUCTION AND APPLICATIONS (NATURAL COMPUTING SERIES), , SPRINGER; BUZAN, T., (2007) MENTAL MAPPING, , PRAGUE PORTAL; CAGNAZZO, L., TIACCI, L., ROSSI, V., KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN SMES WITHIN STABLE ENTERPRISE NETWORKS (2014) WSEAS TRANSACTIONS ON BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS, 11, PP. 155-174; CATANIA, V., PATTI, D., PALESI, M., SPADACCINI, A., FAZZINO, F., AN OPEN AND PLATFOM-INDEPENDENT INSTRUCTION-SET SIMULATOR FOR TEACHING COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE (2014) WSEAS TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS, 11, PP. 42-50; CLAUNCH, C., (2012) TOP 10 STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGY TRENDS FOR 2013, , GARTNER; (2011) COMMUNICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT, , UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME IN USA, AND OSLO GOVERNANCE CENTRE IN NORWAY; (2013) COMPANY PRESENTATION, , INFINEON TECHNOLOGIES AG; CONSUMER INNOVATION PROGRAM ONLINE, , HTTP://IMAGINEH2O.ORG/PRIZES/ENTER-2012.PHP, CIT. 2012-12-04; CORONA, E., PANI, F.E., A REVIEW OF LEAN- KANBAN APPROACHES IN THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (2013) WSEAS TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS, 10, PP. 1-13; DEFINITION OF INFORMATION, DATA - INFORMATION - KNOWLEDGE ONLINE, , HTTP://WEB.SKS.CZ/USERS/KU/ZIZ/INFORM1.HTM, CIT. 2013-01-15; DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATA AND INFORMATION ONLINE, , HTTP://WWW.DIFFERENCEBETWEEN.NET/LANGUAGE/DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-DATA-AND-INFORMATION/, CIT. 2012-11-20; EXPLORING SOCIAL INNOVATIONS ONLINE, , HTTP://WWW.INNOV8SOCIAL.COM/, CIT. 2013-04-05; FUTURE NEEDS KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN EUROPE OUTLOOK 2020 ONLINE, , HTTP://WWW.EUROGUIDANCE.CZ/CZ/PUBLIKACEEUROGUIDANCE/BUDOUCI-POTREBY-ZNALOSTI-ADOVEDNOSTI-V-EVROPE-VYHLED-DO-ROKU-2020.HTML, CEDEFOP EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING.

THIS OFTEN RESULTS IN TEAM MEMBERS OVER EMPHASIZING THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOALS, WITHOUT PROPER INCORPORATION OF GOALS FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS OR CUSTOMERS. EXISTING UML OR OTHER GOAL ORIENTED MODELING METHODS TEND TO BE OVERLY COMPLEX FOR NON-TECHNICAL STAKEHOLDERS TO PROPERLY EXPRESS THEIR GOALS AND COMMUNICATE THEM TO THE AGILE TEAM. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A LIGHT WEIGHT GOAL NET BASED METHOD TO MODEL GOAL REQUIREMENTS IN AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IT CAN BE USED TO DECOMPOSE COMPLEX PROCESSES INTO PHASED GOALS, AND MODEL LOW LEVEL USER STORIES TO HIGH LEVEL HIERARCHY GOAL STRUCTURES. OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS AND STUDIES IN EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CONTEXTS SHOW THAT IT CAN IMPROVE AGILE TEAM'S GROUP AWARENESS TO PROJECT GOALS AND, THUS, IMPROVE TEAM PRODUCTIVITY AND ARTIFACT QUALITY. THE PROPOSED APPROACH WAS EVALUATED IN UNIVERSITY LEVEL AGILE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECTS.

THEY ARE BASED ON AGILE PRINCIPLES THAT SHARPLY CONTRAST TO TRADITIONAL COMMAND-AND-CONTROL MANAGEMENT METHODS. SUCH METHODS EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HIGHLY INTERACTIVE SELF-ORGANIZING TEAMS AND CLOSE COLLABORATION OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS, AS WELL AS VALUES LIKE COURAGE, OPENNESS AND RESPECT. HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT GRADUATES AND UNDERGRADUATES OF COMPUTER SCIENCE OFTEN LACK THE COLLABORATIVE AND COMMUNICATIVE SKILLS NECESSARY FOR AGILE METHODS AND, THUS, ARE NOT YET WELL ENOUGH EDUCATED FOR AGILE DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES. THEREFORE, NEW APPROACHES OR MORE ADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL METHODS FOR TEACHING THE NECESSARY COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION SKILLS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW STUDY, THE AUTHORS ELICITED SPECIFIC COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS NEEDED IN AGILE TEAMS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY AND DISCUSS TEACHING CONCEPTS FOR COLLABORATION SKILLS FROM BOTH ENGINEERING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL POINTS OF VIEW. WE SUGGEST AN APPROACH ON HOW TO INTEGRATE THESE CONCEPTS INTO UNIVERSITY COURSES, THAT FOCUSES ON ACTIVE LEARNING OF AGILE COLLABORATION. WE HAVE STARTED IMPLEMENTING THE PROPOSED CONCEPT IN A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING COURSE AND REPORT ON THE EXPERIENCES WE HAVE MADE AND ON THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED. © 2014 IEEE.";"";"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; COMMUNICATION; ENGINEERING EDUCATION; COLLABORATION SKILLS; COMMAND-AND-CONTROL; COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATIONS; COMMUNICATION SKILLS; MANAGEMENT METHOD; SELF-ORGANIZING TEAMS; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING COURSE; TEACHING AND LEARNING; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"";"HTTP://AGILEMANIFESTO.ORG, AGILE MANIFESTO. 28.11.2013; BECK, K., (2004) EXTREME PROGRAMMING EXPLAINED: EMBRACE CHANGE, , ADDISON-WESLEY; LUZ, M., GAZINEU, D., TEÓFILO, M., CHALLENGES ON ADOPTING SCRUM FOR DISTRIBUTED TEAMS IN HOME OFFICE ENVIRONMENTS (2009) WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, 59, PP. 308-311; KROPP, M., MEIER, A., TEACHING AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL: VALUES MANAGEMENT AND CRAFTSMANSHIP, , CSEE&T 2013 SAN FRANCISCO; SCHROEDER, A., KLARL, A., MAYER, P., KROI, C., TEACHING AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH LAB COURSES (2012) GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (E DUCON, , IEEE; WILLIAMS, L., BROWN, G., MELTZER, A., NAGAPPAN, N., SCRUM + ENGINEERING PRACTICES: EXPERIENCES OF THREE MICROSOFT TEAMS (2011) INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND MEASUREMENT (ESEM, , BANFF CANADA; SCHARF, A., KOCH, A., SCRUM IN A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING COURSE: AN IN-DEPTH PRAXIS REPORT, , CSEE&T 2013 SAN FRANCISCO; STETTINA, C.J., ZHOU, Z., BÄCK, T., KATZY, B., ACADEMIC EDUCATION OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRACTICES: TOWARDS PLANNING AND IMPROVING CAPSTONE, , COURSES BASED UPON INTENSIVE COACHING AND TEAM ROUTINES CSEE&T 2013 SAN FRANCISCO; OSER, F.K., BAERISWYL, F.J., CHOREOGRAPHIES OF TEACHING: BRIDGING INSTRUCTION TO LEARNING (2001) HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON TEACHING, , IN: V.

THIS PAPER DESCRIBES HOW FUZZY COGNITIVE MAPS (FCM) CAN BE USED AS COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (CI) TOOLS FOR DECISION SUPPORT (DS) IN REDUCING THE RISKS OF THE IMPLICATIONS IN THIS ADAPTATION OR TRANSFORMATION PROCESS. PARTICULARLY, FCM ARE USED IN UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF A SET OF CRITICAL AGILE ADOPTION FACTORS (AAF) PROPOSED IN LITERATURE IN THE SUCCESS OF ADOPTING AGILE. A SET OF PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO SHOW THAT AAF CAN BE EVALUATED WITH THE USE OF FCM AND THEIR EFFECT ON ADOPTION SUCCESS IS VALIDATED IN THREE SPECIFIC CONTEXTS. THE SCENARIOS INVESTIGATED SHOW THAT A CRITICAL IMPLICATION IS CORPORATE BUREAUCRACY. ALSO, RESULTS INDICATE THAT SOME ENABLERS ARE THE PROJECT TEAMS’ PERSONAL TRAITS, SUCH AS COLLABORATIVE ATTITUDE AND READINESS TO CHANGE, AS WELL AS, THE CUSTOMERS’ LEVEL OF COMMITMENT.

AS THE EMPHASIS OF USER EXPERIENCE WORK HAS INHERENTLY BEEN ON THE EARLY PHASES BEFORE STARTING THE DEVELOPMENT, IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE ADAPTED TO THE AGILE WAY OF WORKING. TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT PRACTICES IN AGILE USER EXPERIENCE WORK, WE DETERMINED THE PRESENT STATE OF A MULTI-CONTINENTAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION THAT ALREADY HAD A FUNCTIONING USER EXPERIENCE TEAM. IN THIS PAPER, WE DESCRIBE THE MOST PREVALENT ISSUES REGARDING THE INTERACTION OF USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS TO FIX THOSE. MOST OF THE OBSERVED PROBLEMS WERE RELATED TO COMMUNICATION ISSUES AND TO THE SERVICE MODE OF THE USER EXPERIENCE TEAM.
