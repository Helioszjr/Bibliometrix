AB Agile methodologies are the preferred strategy for work teams around the world thanks to their rapid response to changes and adaptability. However, this prioritization of efficiency and speed has neglected the well-being of the most important element of any project: the teams. This article presents NEKO as a super-agile methodology focused on people and that aims to prioritize the mental health of workers without neglecting effectiveness, relying on new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence to enhance its processes. During the research stage, using the methodology proposed by Kitchenham, fifteen articles were analyzed and allowed us to rescue the strengths and identify the problems presented by the agile methodologies most used today. Then, the proposal was developed dividing it into three phases; each including events, artifacts, and tools to achieve your goal. Later, during the discussion, the proposal was contrasted with the methodologies initially analyzed and it was concluded that taking the points in favor of these and adding state-of-the-art technology focused on the well-being of the teams is synonymous with efficiency, meaning a possible change in the paradigm of the current world of work.

AB The number of machine learning, artificial intelligence or data science related software engineering projects using Agile methodology is increasing. However, there are very few studies on how such projects work in practice. In this paper, we analyze project issues tracking data taken from Scrum (a popular tool for Agile) for several machine learning projects. We compare this data with corresponding data from non-machine learning projects, in an attempt to analyze how machine learning projects are executed differently from normal software engineering projects. On analysis, we find that machine learning project issues use different kinds of words to describe issues, have higher number of exploratory or research oriented tasks as compared to implementation tasks, and have a higher number of issues in the product backlog after each sprint, denoting that it is more difficult to estimate the duration of machine learning project related tasks in advance. After analyzing this data, we propose a few ways in which Agile machine learning projects can be better logged and executed, given their differences with normal software engineering projects.

AB Today, the dramatic impact of digital transformation on business, education and private life are becoming more apparent each day. Considering the effect of major environmental events such as the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, technology has become even more influential. In this context, the very rapid developments in technologies such as cloud computing, internet of things, machine learning, artificial intelligence and 5G and consequently the need for continuous upskilling of expert human resources have made the adaptation of traditional learning and teaching methods to this new human condition a vital issue. While the aforementioned phenomenon is being experienced, a talent gap is observed between the competencies of the graduates of Computer Science Engineering, Software Engineering, Industrial Engineering and other related departments and industry expectations as a result of the traditional education approaches of the universities. The shortening of the lifespan of the produced vocational knowledge day by day continues to increase this gap. For this reason, it has become more important than ever that higher education institutions have an approach that is more suitable for this dynamic environment. In this study, it has been examined whether the agile methods, which have become widespread within software industry in the last 15 years, have similar potential when used as a training method. During the study, 49 students from the engineering faculty of a Turkish University participated in the "Agile Software and Product Development" course. The curriculum design, learning experiences, student performance considerations and the other results have been shared. In this course, 3 Sprints are designed with 8 Agile Project Teams that are self- organized with the Scrum framework. Continuous team learning opportunities were evaluated and the difficulties encountered in applying "agility" approach to students while developing innovative ideas and the effect of agile method on the performance of learning were examined. The study is considered to provide useful information for universities, faculty members, agile coaches, students, and firms and professionals in the Information and Communication Technologies industry.

ID PRIORITIZATION
AB The agile methodology has been increasingly deployed in the industry world, breaking the process into cycles of planning, executing, and evaluating. In the software development domain, an agile method named continuous integration is widely used to automatically integrate code changes from different developers into the same software. Then, each new build can be tested to make sure that the modifications did not interfere with the rest of the already verified code. Despite being very important, regression tests are usually the costliest part of a project. It is laborious to retest all tests of each new software version due to the time it takes to perform and often, before all tests are finished, a new software version is ready to be tested. To improve regression tests results, a selection can be done. By selecting the right tests at the right moment, the use of all test catalogs can be avoided to find faults in the software tested. The aim of this work is to develop a method to select tests to be executed for each version using artificial intelligence algorithms. Learning algorithms can find patterns and similarities between test cases to help knowing which one has a higher probability to expose a fault.

DE Challenge Based Learning; Agile methodology; Innovation; Engineering
AB "It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people, so they can tell us what to do." Steve Jobs on Forbes. More than ever, society faces a panoply of complex challenges, from development of artificial intelligence, smart cities, health and well-being, and new energies that will improve the quality of life for the majority of the world population. These are complex issues demanding higher skills, "big ideas", awe-inspiring solutions, from today's top leaders.
   At higher education there is a pool of young, creative, curious living human beings, the students, eager to make an impact in the world, to solve the problems of today's and tomorrow's society. However, to bridge the gap between knowledge and societal demands, these students are asked to apply interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary knowledge, beyond the one learned at one single subject.
   In order to better prepare the Engineering Bachelor students for the emerging Innovation Driven spirit, this study presents an application of a novel teaching scheme at the School of Engineering of the Polytechnic of Porto, in the academic year of 2018/2019, in a laboratory class, LSIS2, from the Systems' Engineering Bachelor Degree. We apply a combination of the Challenge Based Learning (CBL) and of the Scrum framework from the Agile methodology, to boost the students' participation in this innovation process. In this empirical study, students will be challenged to propose a new idea for a new product or service, develop a new conceptual model, and evaluate the model using a series of surveys. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the methodologies implemented will be shown, as well as the benefits and difficulties felt by the students in their implementation.

AB Dynamic System Development Method has been criticized because of absence security practices in its phases. The key objective is proposed the secure software development framework. CBR-DSDM model had proposed in this paper to cover the security in an entire development life cycle of DSDM phases from the beginning to final phase. This paper proposes a way to map security activities into the dynamic system development method. A Case based reasoning technique is used for maintaining security requirement repository. The main purpose of this research is to fill the gap by integrating security into DSDM phases and maintaining its agility. Our model is evaluated using publish case study. For the Assessment of CBR-DSDM used the control experiment and expert review evaluation methods.

AB This article aims to give an idea of how to develop expert systems to help society in all senses. The rules of induction used with MYCIN can help us in medicine, agricultura, and the financial system, implementing an inference engine with different rules so that in case there are no people, the expert system can diagnose in a clear and precise way, based on a knowledge base with some consequents and their corresponding antecedents, these artificial intelligence algorithms used will allow us to determine what type of consequence or conclusion it gives us, of the chaining of several antecedents with structured programming to give us its corresponding answer, then this research is aimed at obtaining an agile methodology for expert systems that will help us in the development and implementation of this type of systems.

AB Background: Body image and eating disorders represent a significant public health concern; however, many affected individuals never access appropriate treatment. Conversational agents or chatbots reflect a unique opportunity to target those affected online by providing psychoeducation and coping skills, thus filling the gap in service provision.
   Objective: A world-first body image chatbot called "KIT" was designed. The aim of this study was to assess preliminary acceptability and feasibility via the collection of qualitative feedback from young people and parents/carers regarding the content, structure, and design of the chatbot, in accordance with an agile methodology strategy. The chatbot was developed in collaboration with Australia's national eating disorder support organization, the Butterfly Foundation.
   Methods: A conversation decision tree was designed that offered psychoeducational information on body image and eating disorders, as well as evidence-based coping strategies. A version of KIT was built as a research prototype to deliver these conversations. Six focus groups were conducted using online semistructured interviews to seek feedback on the KIT prototype. This included four groups of people seeking help for themselves (n=17; age 13-18 years) and two groups of parents/carers (n=8; age 46-57 years). Participants provided feedback on the cartoon chatbot character design, as well as the content, structure, and design of the chatbot webchat.
   Results: Thematic analyses identified the following three main themes from the six focus groups: (1) chatbot character and design, (2) content presentation, and (3) flow. Overall, the participants provided positive feedback regarding KIT, with both young people and parents/carers generally providing similar reflections. The participants approved of KIT's character and engagement. Specific suggestions were made regarding the brevity and tone to increase KIT's interactivity.
   Conclusions: Focus groups provided overall positive qualitative feedback regarding the content, structure, and design of the body image chatbot. Incorporating the feedback of lived experience from both individuals and parents/carers allowed the refinement of KIT in the development phase as per an iterative agile methodology. Further research is required to evaluate KIT's efficacy.

AB We propose a new research framework by which the nascent discipline of human-AI teaming can be explored within experimental environments in preparation for transferal to real-world contexts. We examine the existing literature and unanswered research questions through the lens of an Agile approach to construct our proposed framework. Our framework aims to provide a structure for understanding the macro features of this research landscape, supporting holistic research into the acceptability of human-AI teaming to human team members and the affordances of AI team members. The framework has the potential to enhance decision-making and performance of hybrid human-AI teams. Further, our framework proposes the application of Agile methodology for research management and knowledge discovery. We propose a transferability pathway for hybrid teaming to be initially tested in a safe environment, such as a real-time strategy video game, with elements of lessons learned that can be transferred to real-world situations.

AB The present research aims to develop an application that allows the early and timely detection of signs of problems in the mental health of citizens. Agile methodology was used, with its SCRUM framework developing its four steps. In addition, technological tools such as artificial intelligence, mobile appli-cations, social networks and the python programming language were used. Also using SQL Server, Android Studio and the Marvel applications, the latter for the design of the prototypes, through the method of sentiment analysis and machine learning, in order to create a mobile application that is as accurate as possible in its results. For this, several types of algorithm were evaluated, managing to select the most appropriate one since it works based on information collected through the social networks Facebook and Twitter. The result that was obtained was the application that uses machine learning to prevent and take care of mental health in Peru, thus benefiting the citizens of society.

AB this research presents a serious 3D game over a computer cluster that allows the learning of traffic signals so that the child is a responsible driver and pedestrian. For this purpose, we have applied an agile methodology to be able to produce a driving and pedestrian simulation system as a serious game, which includes a three-layer hierarchical architecture (orientation layer, management layer, and control layer). This architecture can be used to simulate three environments that are: a) Driver's environment; b) Pedestrian environment; c) Vehicle traffic observer environment. All these environments are controlled by intelligent agents that allow the user to handle the autonomous longitudinal control, the relative distance, the speed of the cars, the collisions between vehicles, the pedestrian collision, excess of the speed limit, circulation in the opposite direction, and respect of traffic signals. Our solution to traffic problems has been validated by the execution of several tests in public schools, and the results demonstrate that this simulation application encourages learning in road safety education for children between 9 and 12 years old, using a distributed environment with a computational cluster in the cloud.

AB A picture can express something instead of having a thousand words that cannot do it. This phrase, which symbolically connotes a whole scheme of a signs system, is known as Semiotics. This paper presents the process of an educational video game development based on semiotic analysis. We used Extreme Programing Agile Methodology combined with a proposal of the modified Elemental Tetrad Game Design Model to develop a video game known as "Tic-Tac-Toe". The mathematical model was implemented with Artificial Intelligence algorithms and a graphical user interface including Semiotics; this was optimized for producing an enjoyable and interactive environment. With the purpose of stimulating cognitive development of children, this research combines theories about stimulating cognitive development of children; game design model, Semiotic Analysis harnesses the Model of Aleferenko, and uses algorithms based on heuristics and numerical methods in client-server architecture. The concept was tested with a representative sample of seven to eleven years old children. The results demonstrated that educational video games with Semiotics stimulate the cognitive development of children.

AB Context: Over the last decade, Agile methods have changed the software development process in an unparalleled way and with the increasing popularity of Big Data, optimizing development cycles through data analytics is becoming a commodity. Objective: Although a myriad of research exists on software analytics as well as on Agile software development (ASD) practice on itself, there exists no systematic overview of the research done on ASD from a data analytics perspective. Therefore, the objective of this work is to make progress by linking ASD with Big Data analytics (BDA). Method: As the primary method to find relevant literature on the topic, we performed manual search and snowballing on papers published between 2011 and 2019. Results: In total, 88 primary studies were selected and analyzed. Our results show that BDA is employed throughout the whole ASD lifecycle. The results reveal that data-driven software development is focused on the following areas: code repository analytics, defects/bug fixing, testing, project management analytics, and application usage analytics. Conclusions: As BDA and ASD are fast-developing areas, improving the productivity of software development teams is one of the most important objectives BDA is facing in the industry. This study provides scholars with information about the state of software analytics research and the current trends as well as applications in the business environment. Whereas, thanks to this literature review, practitioners should be able to understand better how to obtain actionable insights from their software artifacts and on which aspects of data analytics to focus when investing in such initiatives.

AB The world of education system after this COVID-19 pandemic will have to change its dimension to map the needs of learners. The proposed framework is focused on transforming the learning experience into two possible ways like online and on-campus learning through groundbreaking & agile methodologies. The new interfaces for learners will be included like Gamification, animated tutorial etc. The framework designed here is the outcome of the e-learning experiences of the authors and it tries to add all relevant technologies with cutting-edge research to provide inspirational and transformative knowledge to learners of all ages, social status, communities who form worldwide communities of special-learners. It will rise to the occasion to use its open source technology along with the emerged technologies like IoT, 5G etc, to transcend physical and social borders. This framework is a total learning environment as it will incorporate all possible latest technologies like big data and machine learning. The e-learning system possesses features like personalized e-learning, anomaly detection, student performance monitoring, dynamic content preparations, students' satisfaction monitoring etc. The new framework will include big data, cloud applications, machine learning and artificial intelligence to make the system faster, efficient and smart. The new features will make the e-learning system based on Virtual Smart Total Learning Environment (VSTLE) more technologically sound and efficient in processing, predicting, evaluating and making storage backup. This framework is designed in such a way that the minimum human intervention will be needed for its functioning. As a result, the final output will be more accurate as compared to other e-learning systems available.

AB Contemporary worlds of both the real and the virtual ones merge. Here comes the fourth revolution which equals to digitization. The digitization of customer service means for many companies the necessity of integration with the current exponential changes. Digitization impose changes in business models. Contemporary technologies like Internet of things, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and big data open new opportunities for enterprises but are very challenging at the same time. But especially for companies operating in a virtual environment customer service based on modern technologies became obligatory. These new technologies allowing full customization of the offer and highest level of customer service with acceptable costs and inputs. Using of these new technologies determine the position of the companies in the market. Instant share of knowledge, files, and customer related data across enterprise become crucial for gaining competitive advantage these days in turbulent and unpredictable business environment. Connect all employees with experts from whole organization regardless of their role or location is the best and most effective way to react quickly and proactively for customer's needs and expectations. Collaborate on sales opportunities, customer service cases and requests, marketing campaigns and innovative projects with embedded applications and custom workflows within one common integrated system open new markets. Agile (agility) become very popular term worldwide as proper usage of agile methodologies in business (especially in customer service) may lead to market success. This paper is devoted to the role of new technologies in the processes of customer service and enterprise social networks and collaboration. But also key issues in the introduction and use of these technologies are described. Authors presents how properly implemented instant communication tools can accelerate productivity and overall performance of the business including but not limited to sales and customer service processes. The article is based on case studies, research and experience authors have using one of the top CRM solution - Salesforce. In particular enterprise collaboration platform introduced by Salesforce called Chatter.

AB Advancements in Cloud-native services, Machine-Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Rapid Application Development (RAD) using the Agile methodology has led countless industries to achieving desirable levels of automation while reducing cost and improving quality software deployments, timely / iterative delivery, and accountability. Coupling this framework with the principle of security as a shared responsibility further enhances the efficacy of an integrated Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) Team within organizations to deliver secured digital solutions. Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved through multiyear, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts-in terms of new capabilities-in constant investment decision planning cycles, costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this automation evolution vision for ANSPs.
   This paper examines the migration from today's systems to secure, cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations, like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that must be considered for this evolution.
